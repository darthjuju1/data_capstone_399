Chuck Berry,Sweet Little Sixteen,/c/chuck+berry/sweet+little+sixteen_20030910.html,"They're really rockin' Boston  
In Pittsburgh, P. A.  
Deep in the heart of Texas  
And 'round the Frisco Bay  
All over St. Louis  
And down in New Orleans  
All the cats want to dance with  
Sweet little sixteen  
  
Sweet little sixteen  
She's just got to have  
About half a million  
Framed autographs  
Her wallet filled with pictures  
She gets 'em one by one  
Become so excited  
Watch her, look at her run  
  
Oh mommy mommy  
Please may I go  
It's such a sight to see  
Somebody steal the show  
Oh daddy daddy  
I beg of you  
Whisper to mommy  
It's all right with you  
  
'Cause they'll be rockin' on Bandstand  
In Philadelphia P.A.  
Deep in the heart of Texas  
And 'round the Frisco Bay  
All over St. Louis  
Way down in New Orleans  
All the cats want to dance with  
Sweet little sixteen  
  
'Cause they'll be rockin' on Bandstand  
Philadelphia P.A.  
Deep in the heart of Texas  
And 'round the Frisco Bay  
All over St. Louis  
Way down in New Orleans  
All the cats want to dance with  
Sweet little sixteen  
  
Sweet little sixteen  
She's got the grown up blues  
Tight dresses and lipstick  
She's sportin' high heel shoes  
Oh, but tomorrow morning  
She'll have to change her trend  
And be sweet sixteen  
And back in class again  
  
Well they'll be rockin' Boston  
Pittsburgh, P. A.  
Deep in the heart of Texas  
And 'round the Frisco Bay  
Way out in St. Louis  
Way down to New Orleans  
All the cats want to dance with  
Sweet little sixteen

Came to nothin' at all my love  
When I woke up to find  
You were no longer mine  
All my love  
Throw away after all this time  
Now there's no place for me  
In the future you see  
I don't understand you  
I've done all I can do  
Tell me how could I give you more  
More than all my love

And since you hard like blow, now tell me what you in for  
You and your partner ride a Benz, but your endz low  
You shake it, we take it, that's how we get it on the blow

Smoke angel dust, be ridin' at night in Jags and stuff  
And hit a nigga, prolly turn into a massacre

Please don't play, cause all day I been inhalin' blunts  
And my whole mind is blown away  
I feel like killing stuff (Skurt!)  
I pull up in a dropped Hummer  
And shoot 50 at them cocksuckers  
Say biatch, it don't, Wodie let me get 'em  
Just gimme the word, Unless shawty gonna spit 'em  
Nigga's blessings be with 'em, cause Lil Wayne burn niggas

The Jam,The Modern World,/j/jam/the+modern+world_20068921.html,"This is a modern world, this is the modern world  
What kind of a fool do you think I am?  
You think I know nothing of the modern world  
All my life has been the same  
I've learned to live by hate and pain  
It's my inspiration drive  
I've learned more than you'll ever know  
Even at school I felt quite sure  
That one day I would be on top  
And I'd look down upon the map  
  
The teachers who said I'd be nothing  
This is the modern world that I've learnt about  
This is the modern world, we don't need no one  
To tell us what's right or wrong  
Say what you like 'cause I don't care  
I know where I am and going too  
It's somewhere I won't preview  
Don't have to explain myself to you  
I don't give two fucks about your review

Uriah Heep,My Joanna Needs Tuning,/u/uriah+heep/my+joanna+needs+tuning_20142302.html,"I was waiting for somebody  
This afternoon  
Hope that she remembered  
Our rendezvouz  
And when she didn't show  
Just like yesterday  
I do the last, I'll find another way  
One night I saw the stranger  
Across the hall  
I knew he was the reason  
Why she didn't call  
I wish I had imagined  
Or dreamt the lot  
But the heart didn't choose  
The pain I've got  
Now she' turning me inside out  
Upside down  
And me heart is all a roundabout  
Spinnin' round  
She's turnin' me inside out  
Inside out  
She's turnin' me inside out  
Inside out  
Now he's got all so melt  
With a diamond ring  
And she was thinking through  
Almost anything  
She's like a shadow going up  
Seventh avenue  
But so what, she's only going  
Where she's didn't to  
I just got one thing to say  
Just before I go  
Since he was the offender  
I want her to know  
Now my mind has got me the day  
I'm watching to  
I'll never raise a thought  
Of what she'd done

Tears For Fears,Power,/t/tears+for+fears/power_20135534.html,"Last years rivals share their blood  
Sailor sworn to secrecy  
Ride the waves and stem the flood  
The tides of endless enmity  
Power now is all the rage  
Sons and daughters of the gun  
Hungry babies come of age  
Phasers switched and set to stun  
Power now, power how, power wow!  
Here's power  
If you're seeking power . . .  
Doctor held you tight and torn  
Boy he was a lucky man  
Out of you the future born  
Slight of foot and sight of hand  
Douse the candle, dim the light  
Focus not on fire or flame  
Don't believe that might is right  
Your soul can turn you just the same  
Power now, power how, power wow !  
If you're seeking power - here's power  
Power now, power how, power wow !  
If you're seeking power - here's power  
If you take my breath away  
The whole damn thing will turn and return  
Redefined, rearranged, rearranged  
And till my dying the day  
I guess I'll have to burn just to learn  
This the time, this the place  
To show a human face  
Dressed to kill we guessed you might  
Friend or foe or family  
We'll sacrifice the Virgin white  
Her death will be the life of me  
Power now is all the rage  
Don't excuse it use it well  
Keep the lion in his cage  
Free from hunger, free from hell  
Power now, power how, power wow !  
If you're seeking power - here's power!

Joni Mitchell,Lesson In Survival,/j/joni+mitchell/lesson+in+survival_20075336.html,"Lesson in Survival  
Spinning out on turns  
That gets you tough  
Guru books-the Bible  
Only a reminder  
That you're just not good enough  
You need to believe in something  
Once I could in our love  
Black road  
Double yellow line  
Friends and kin  
Campers in the kitchen  
That's fine sometimes  
But I know my needs  
My sweet tumbleweed  
I need more quiet times  
By a river flowing  
You and me  
Deep kisses  
And the sun going down  
  
Maybe it's paranoia  
Maybe it's sensitivity  
Your friends protect you  
Scrutinize me  
I get so damn timid  
Not at all the spirit  
That's inside of me  
Oh baby I can't seem to make it  
With you socially  
There's this reef around me  
I'm looking way out at the ocean  
Love to see that green water in motion  
I'm going to get a boat  
And we can row it  
If you ever get the notion  
To be needed by me  
Fresh salmon frying  
And the tide rolling in  
  
I went to see a friend tonight  
'Was very late when I walked in  
My talking as it rambled  
Revealed suspicious reasoning  
The visit seemed to darken him  
I came in as bright  
As a neon light  
And I burned out  
Right there before him  
I told him these things  
I'm telling you now  
Watched them buckle up  
In his brow  
When you dig down deep  
You lose good sleep  
And it makes you  
Heavy company  
I will always love you  
Hands alike  
Magnet and iron  
The souls

Holy smoke, somebody blew up the pope  
Living in a cage in the USA  
All around us the rules are changing  
Taller walls and stronger cages  
Nothing is sacred or too outrageous  
Taller walls and stronger cages  
  
What in the world is happening to the world?  
What in the world?  
Driving in your Mercedes you think you're safe, but you're never safe in a

Before you're here you're already gone  
And even with the light all around you  
You're all alone in the dark.  
  
You're breaking your own heart  
Taking it too far down a lonely road  
You say it's just one love  
But when it's close enough you just let it go  
The very thing you've been the most afraid of  
You've been doing it from the start, breaking your own heart.  
  
Too many tears, too many falls  
It's easier here behind these walls  
But you don't have to walk in the shadows  
When life is so hard.  
  
You're breaking your own heart  
Taking it too far down a lonely road  
You say it's just one love  
But when it's close enough you just let it go

You've been doing it from the start, breaking your own heart.  
  
You're breaking your own heart.  
It's not too late, I'm still right here.  
If only you let go of your fears.

Taking your own heart down a lonely road  
You say it's just one love  
But when it's close enough you just let it go  
The very thing you've been the most afraid of  
You've been doing it from the start, breaking your own heart.

Makin' it shiver and shake  
And a permanent cry fallin' out of the sky  
Slippery and sly like a snake  
  
With a delicate move kind of shifty and smooth  
A shadow has covered the light  
Then a beam in the shade from a silvery blade  
Has shattered the edge of the night  
  
I know she waits below  
Only to rise on command  
When she comes for me  
She's got my life in her hands  
  
When a movement behind hit the side of my mind  
I trembled and shook it away  
Then another assault and I started to falter  
Fibers of steel turned to clay  
  
With a bubbly turn now the water should churn  
And push it way from the core  
And a lady in white will bring sun to the night  
Brighter than ever before  
  
I know she waits below  
Only to rise on command  
When she comes for me  
She's got my life in her hands

Blinded and bruised by the strain  
There must be some way to see  
Diamonds out of the rain

A battery the anti-equilibrius  
Your stomach becomes the floor

A light goes on upstairs  
The attic ablaze  
This island isn't big enough  
For both of us who will swim  
In ell infested oceans  
Kiss the sand goodbye because  
The tide is coming up and in  
Ya water water water everywhere  
And every chance to sink  
  
Its an amalgamation of the things  
You aren't the ways you wish you were  
A split second perceiving of the way  
You really look to everyone of them  
I wish that you could get a glimpse  
I wish that you could see because  
  
The look on your face was priceless!

I know one thing this is true  
I couldn't want anyone half as bad as you  
  
I hope these words get your attention  
Sometimes I get carried away  
With what I say is it okay-ay-ay-ayy?  
  
I don't know how much more I can take  
Stuck in a dream and I don't want to wake  
'Cause this is real and it's not a mistake  
I know one thing this is true  
You love me and I love you  
I couldn't want anyone half as bad as you

He'd never seen that dress before  
She seemed to sail right through  
Those dark clouds forming  
That he knows he's headed for  
After seven years of marriage  
He wanted out  
Now after seven months of freedom  
It's clear that there's no doubt  
She's gonna make it  
And he never will  
He's at the foot of the mountain  
And she's over that hill  
He's sinkin' at sea  
And her sails are filled  
She's gonna make it  
And he never will  
And you know it's not like she's forgot about him  
She's just dealing with the pain  
And the fact that she's survived so well without him  
You know it's driving him insane  
And the crazy thing about it  
Is she'd take him back  
But the fool in him that walked out  
Is the fool who just won't ask  
She's gonna make it  
And he never will  
He's at the foot of the mountain  
And she's over that hill  
He's sinkin' at sea  
And her sails are filled  
She's gonna make it  
And he never will  
She's gonna make it  
He never will

Dan Fogelberg,Sutter's Mill,/d/dan+fogelberg/sutters+mill_20035724.html,"In the Spring of Forty-seven,  
So the story, it is told,  
Old John Sutter went to the mill site  
Found a piece of shining gold.  
  
Well, he took it to the city  
Where the word, like wildfire, spread.  
And old John Sutter soon came to wish he'd  
Left that stone in the river bed.  
  
For they came like herds of locusts  
Every woman, child and man  
In their lumbering Conestogas  
They left their tracks upon the land.  
  
[Chorus]  
Some would fail and some would prosper  
Some would die and some would kill  
Some would thank the Lord for their deliverance  
And some would curse John Sutter's Mill.  
  
Well, they came from New York City,  
And they came from Alabam'  
With their dreams of finding fortunes  
In this wild unsettled land.  
  
Well, some fell prey to hostile arrows  
As they tried to cross the plains.  
And some were lost in the Rocky Mountains  
With their hands froze to the reins.  
  
Oh...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, some pushed on to California  
And others stopped to take their rest.  
And by the Spring of Eighteen-sixty  
They had opened up the west.  
  
And then the railroad came behind them  
And the land was plowed and tamed,  
When Old John Sutter went to meet his maker,  
He'd not one penny to his name.  
  
Oh...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And some would curse John Sutter's Mill  
Some men's thirsts are never filled.

Inside 1000 people with yellow ribbons sing

A medley: hits from Grease  
Watch him burn  
He never fails to please  
Meanwhile in Taho outside Casa Tony  
Wetting rags in gasoline  
A jealous Frankie Valli says  
""Dawn, I want you back""  
Lights a match and counts to 3

Watch it burn  
Acrid smoke making him wheeze

Of a tender love that used to be  
  
Now it's the same old song

It's the same old song  
But with a different meaning

Sentimental fool am I  
To hear a old love song and wanna cry  
But the melody keeps haunting me  
Reminding me how in love we used to be  
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our heart  
Saying together forever, breaking up never

But with a different meaning  
Since you been gone  
  
Precious memories keep a lingering on  
Every time I hear our favorite song  
Now you're gone, left this emptiness  
I only reminisce the happiness we spent  
We used to dance to the music  
Make romance through the music

Willie Nelson,As Time Goes By,/w/willie+nelson/as+time+goes+by_20320688.html,"This day and age we're living in  
Gives cause for apprehension  
With speed and new invention  
And things like fourth dimension  
Yet we get a trifle weary  
  
With Mr. Einstein's theory  
So we must get down to earth at times  
Relax relieve the tension  
And no matter what the progress  
  
Or what may yet be proved  
The simple facts of life are such  
They cannot be removed  
  
You must remember this  
A kiss is still a kiss  
A sigh is just a sigh  
The fundamental things apply  
As time goes by  
  
And when two lovers woo  
They still say, ""I love you""  
On that you can rely  
No matter what the future brings  
As time goes by  
  
Moonlight and love songs  
Never out of date  
Hearts full of passion  
Jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny  
  
Well, it's still the same old story  
A fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die  
The world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by  
Oh yes, the world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by

Sting,The Wild Wild Sea,/s/sting/the+wild+wild+sea_20132094.html,"I saw it again this evening  
Black sail in a pale yellow sky  
And just as before in a moment  
It was gone where the grey gulls fly.  
  
If it happens again I shall worry  
That only a strange ship could fly  
And my sanity scans the horizon  
In the light of the darkening sky.  
  
That night as I walked in my slumber  
I waded into the sea strand  
And I swam with the moon and her lover  
Until I lost sight of the land  
  
I swam till the night became morning  
Black sail in a reddening sky  
Found myself on the deck of a rolling ship  
So far where no grey gulls fly  
  
All around me was silence  
As if mocking my frail human hopes  
And a question mark hung in the canvas  
For the wind that had died in the ropes  
  
I may have slept for an hour  
I may have slept for a day  
For I woke in a bed of white linen  
And the sky was the colour of clay.  
  
At first just a rustle of canvas  
And the gentlest breath on my face  
But a galloping line of white horses  
Said that soon we were in for a race  
  
The gentle sigh turned to a howling  
And the grey sky she angered to black  
And my anxious eyes searched the horizon  
With the gathering sea at my back  
  
Did I see the shade of a sailor  
On the bridge through the wheelhouse pane  
Held fast to the wheel of the rocking ship  
As I squinted my eyes in the rain  
  
For the ship had turned into the wind  
Against the storm to brace  
And underneath the sailor's hat  
I saw my father's face  
  
If a prayer today is spoken  
Please offer it for me  
When the bridge to heaven is broken  
And you're lost on the wild wild sea  
Lost on the wild wild sea...

Caught in this human cage,  
Trapped, and I'm fired up with rage  
And somebody's got to pay  
I can never talk about it,  
I can never say what I want to say  
So I'll take your tip and I'll bite my lip  
And hope it goes away  
You say I'm a man of straw  
Well, baby, I'm gonna break your law  
Then it's war, ooh, yes it's war  
Love on a thin white line,  
Love that was just a waste of time,  
Oh, not anymore  
I can feel it coming at me,  
I can feel it coming like the wind  
But, I'm locked away and I'm bound to stay,  
So no one can get in  
I'm a man in chains, I'm a man in chains  
Oh, I'm a man in chains, I'm a man in chains  
I only pray that before I die,  
Just like a phoenix I will rise and fly  
Tell me who's to blame,  
Oh, I'm a man, now I'm a man in chains  
There must be a reason why  
You're pulling the wool down on my eyes  
It's a lie, it's a lie  
Dragging this ball and chain,  
Oh, how long can I take this pain?  
But somebody has to try, yeah  
Oh, I can feel the pressure on me,  
I can feel it taking me from the start  
Sticks and stones will smash my bones,  
But never break my heart  
I'm a man in chains, I'm a man in chains  
Oh, I'm a man in chains, I'm a man in chains  
I only pray that before I die,  
Just like a phoenix I will rise and fly  
Tell me who's to blame,  
Oh, I'm a man, now I'm a man in chains  
I can never talk about it,  
Oh, I can never say what I want to say  
So I'll take your tip and I'll bite my lip  
And hope it goes away  
I'm a man in chains, I'm a man in chains

Iwan Fals,Ada Lagi Yang Mati,/i/iwan+fals/ada+lagi+yang+mati_20583788.html,"Aku lihat orang yang mati  
Diantara tumpukkan sampah  
Lehernya berdarah membeku  
Bekas pisau lawannya tadi malam  
Depan pasar dekat terminal  
Pagi itu orang berkerumun  
Melihat mayat yang membusuk  
Tutup hidung sesekali meludah  
Aku lihat orang menangis  
Disela gaduhnya suasana  
Segera aku menghampiri  
Dengan bimbang ku bertanya padanya  
Rupanya yang mati sang teman  
Teman hitam hidup sepaham  
Hanya kisah yang dilewati  
Ia berdua ikat tali saudara  
Sementara surya mulai tinggi  
Panas terasa bakar kepala  
Sisa darah orang yang mati  
Disimpannya didalam hati  
Lalu dia seperti batu  
Sampai malam sampai semuanya pergi  
Depan pasar dekat terminal  
Ada lagi orang yang mati  
Lehernya berdarah membeku  
Bekas pisau lawannya tadi malam  
Sementara surya mulai tinggi  
Panas terasa bakar kepala  
Dendam ada dimana-mana  
Dijantungku dijantungmu  
Dijantung hari-hari . . . . . . .  
Dendam ada dimana-mana . . . . . . . . . . .

My father left a long, long time ago

My song is a cry of desperation  
All of the words I hear  
Have lost their meaning  
  
My life is a well of confusion  
Drowned out by the sound of the lost and lonely  
Only the voice inside  
Speaks your name to me  
  
If they only knew the things that I know  
If they only could see the things that I see  
  
My brothers at opposite tables  
Like fire and water against each other  
Only a fool can't see  
The obvious ending  
  
Are we as ashes to wildwood  
Is life just a fire that can only consume us  
Is there no vision of love  
To bind us together  
  
If they only knew the things that I know  
If they only could see the things that I see

So when they see us start to fuss and fight  
I guess they think we're through  
But if they're judgin' us by what they see  
Then they don't have a clue about you and me

Used with conviction  
Diffused compulsions  
Unending repercussions  
  
Violent emotion  
Screaming revolution  
Spasmic convulsions

To get myself a little taste  
The music is nice and swinging  
And of course, I really dig the place  
Course, I haven't  
Had much sleep lately  
I feel sorta down and out  
Yeah, but look over there  
In the corner, man  
Oh, yeah, there's something  
To shout about  
Hey, hey, pretty baby  
Girl, don't you go nowhere  
(Are you talking to me)  
I'm talking to you, pretty baby  
Girl, don't you go nowhere  
Cause as soon as I pay the bartender  
Girl, I'll be right there  
She looked up and blushed and smiled  
And my heart skipped a beat  
Mmm, she's stacked from  
Her head down to her feet  
Hey, barkeep  
You better come here and get your bread  
This little girl's getting ready to split  
And I'm about to go out of my head  
Hey, hey, pretty baby  
Girl, don't you go out that door  
(Are you talking to me)  
I'm talking to you, pretty baby  
Girl, don't you go out that door  
I'm afraid if I lose sight of you  
I just might not see you no more  
She slowed up just a little bit  
And turned her head and smiled  
She was 34-24-38  
And dressed in the latest style  
I finally caught up  
With the pretty little thing  
Before she got out on the street  
And she told she was  
Waiting on her old man  
Who was a policeman on the beat  
Hey, hey, pretty baby  
Girl, I'll see you another time  
(Are you talking to me)  
I'm talking to you, pretty baby  
Girl, I'll see you another time  
If you're a policeman's woman  
Lyrics courtesy Top40db.  
Just talking to you is a crime  
(That's right, bud, let's go)  
Oh, no

Tracy Chapman,Bridges,/t/tracy+chapman/bridges_20140237.html,"All the bridges that you burn  
Come back one day to haunt you  
One day you'll find you're walking lonely  
  
Baby I never meant to hurt you  
Sometimes the best intentions  
Still don't make things right  
  
But all my ghosts they find me  
Like my past they think they own me  
In dreams and dark corners they surround me  
Till I cry I cry  
  
Let me take this time to set the record straight  
Let me take this time to take it all back  
Let me take this time to tell you how I felt  
Let me take this time to try and make it right  
  
But you can walk away  
Be all alone  
Spend all your time  
Thinking about the way things used to be  
If love feels right  
You work it out  
You don't give it up  
Baby  
  
Anybody tell you that  
Anybody tell you that  
Anybody tell you that  
  
You should take some time maybe sleep on it tonight  
You should take some time baby heed the words I said  
You should take some time think about your life  
You should take some time before you throw it all away  
  
I ain't got the time  
To sit here and wait around  
But I got the time  
If you say I'm what you want

Bryan White,Heaven Sent,/b/bryan+white/heaven+sent_20025789.html,"One lonely night  
I sent a prayer  
Send me someone  
Someone to care  
Out of the blue  
Suddenly you  
Heaven sent  
  
One magic touch  
One stolen kiss  
My only dream  
My every wish  
That's when I knew  
That it was truly  
Heaven sent  
  
And every star in the sky  
They knew that I  
Had waited my whole life through  
And as I held you tight  
They shined even brighter  
So glad I'd finally found you  
And through the years  
Never forget  
The love we'd found  
The night we met  
And how we knew  
That it was truly  
Heaven sent

You said it was built to last  
Price is right, the time is now  
You said it was going fast  
  
Well I've got my beliefs  
And I don't agree with a single word you say  
A convincing smile, a twist of truth  
You seem to get your way  
  
And they believed you  
With every word you said  
It always sounded so convincing  
As you signed their life away  
So tell me what you're thinking  
When you lie in your bed  
The suffering you've caused  
Surely it must go around your head  
  
Well they call you Mr Cover  
A predator at heart  
A man who's reputation  
Was dangerous from the start  
You lie and you steal, cheat and you rob  
Sold anything you could  
You never had a second thought for people that you hurt  
  
And they believed you  
With every word you said  
It always sounded so convincing  
As you signed their life away  
So tell me what you're thinking  
When you lie in your bed  
The suffering you've caused  
Surely it must go around your head  
  
It's been so many years  
Well you've hurt so many people  
As you've singed their lives away  
Do you ever spare a moment's thought about the price they have to pay?  
  
And they believed you  
With every word you said  
It always sounded so convincing  
As you signed their life away  
So tell me what you're thinking

How can I face the dawn of

I just can't face one day...

I always accepted what you said as the truth  
And the truth only  
Well, it's not enough that you depend on me  
It's not enough that you say you love me  
It's not enough to just save face  
  
Because sometimes you just fall from grace  
Sometimes you just fall from grace  
  
Maybe I am calmer now  
Maybe things are fine  
Maybe I made the whole thing up  
Maybe it isn't a lie  
Maybe the reason I say these things  
Is to bring you back alive  
Maybe I've fought this long and this hard

I drank a six pack of apathy  
Life's a bitch and so am I  
The world owes me, so fuck you  
Wasted youth and a fistful of ideals  
I had a young and optimistic point of view  
Wasted youth and a fistful of ideals  
I had a young and optimistic point of view  
I've decomposed, yet my gut's getting fat  
Oh my god I'm turning out like my dad  
I'm always rude  
I've got a bad attitude  
The world owes me, so fuck you  
The wife's a nag and the kid's fucking up  
I don't have sex 'cause I can't get it up  
I'm just a grouch sitting on the couch  
The world owes me, so fuck you

Queen,Another One Bites The Dust,/q/queen/another+one+bites+the+dust_20112678.html,"Let's go, Steve walks warily down the street,  
With the brim pulled way down low  
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet,  
Machine guns ready to go  
  
Are you ready,  
Are you ready for this  
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat  
Out of the doorway the bullets rip  
To the sound of the beat  
  
[Chorus]  
Another one bites the dust  
Another one bites the dust  
And another one gone, and another one gone  
Another one bites the dust  
Hey, I'm gonna get you too  
Another one bites the dust  
  
How do you think I'm going to get along,  
Without you, when you're gone  
You took me for everything that I had,  
And kicked me out on my own  
  
Are you happy, are you satisfied  
How long can you stand the heat  
Out of the doorway the bullets rip  
To the sound of the beat  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Another one bites the dust  
Another one bites the dust  
Another one bites the dust  
Another one bites the dust  
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man  
And bring him to the ground  
You can beat him  
You can cheat him  
You can treat him bad and leave him  
When he's down  
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you  
I'm standing on my own two feet  
Out of the doorway the bullets rip  
Repeating the sound of the beat  
  
[Chorus]

Makes bleeding hearts begin to beat again

Minutes before dawn I hear your breathing,  
Your heart beat like a song.  
Lately I've been feeling a little less then good but  
Seeing things for the first time like I never could.  
  
I've had my head down against the door,  
Trying to get to something I couldn't find before.  
That special something, that feeds my soul,  
Is a rhythm to live by, it's a rhythm of hope.  
  
Something drives us onwards.  
Something gives us strength.  
What makes our judgment falter is the questions we think.  
Who am I to fly so high?  
What gives me the right to dream of what could be,  
Keep reaching for the light?  
  
I've been standing in front of that door,  
Basing my happiness on what' I knew before.  
Searching for something that moves my soul.  
A rhythm to hold to, a rhythm to live to.  
  
Have you been down like this before?  
I guarantee there's something waiting for you just open that door.  
A rhythm to live by, that moves your soul.  
A rhythm that holds you.  
A rhythm to live to.  
  
And if there's one thing we all need now,  
It's a rhythm to live by, a rhythm of hope.  
  
Lying here awake again

You should turn away cause there's nothing more to say

You only had one life to live  
You fought so hard you were a slave  
  
After all you gave there was nothing left to save  
You've got nothing left to lose (you've got nothing left to lose)  
No you've got nothing left to lose (who'd want to be standing in your shoes)  
Nothing ventured nothing gained

Nothing sacred or profane

There's a simulated sunset  
Starlight in my eyes  
The skies are filled with miracles  
And half of them are lies  
Are you real or not?  
It's a fine line  
Are you ready or not  
For the light of day  
Are you real or not?  
These are strange times  
And I don't want to live this way  
When you wake up from a nightmare  
And it's worse when you're awake  
And there's no one you can turn to  
And there's nothing you can take  
Are you real or not?

Are you ready or not  
For the light of day ?  
Are you real or not?

And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll

Trust me to fall apart, trust you to know  
Just you and no-one else, just me alone  
Why did it have to be? I should have known  
Oh I should have known  
  
I can't tell, did you mean it? Did you mean what I think you did?  
I won't give less you need it, just a bit could be overhead

Ridin' on the wind  
She had all of the answers  
Didn't need to pretend  
I remember she was the only friend I ever needed  
  
Now I wonder  
How to work it all out  
My hands are tremblin'  
I've got this feelin' now  
  
There's a bit of thunder  
Pounding in my heart  
A little uncertainty  
That's been there from the start  
Don't tell me all the look you gave  
Were the ones that I misread  
'Cause all I hear now  
Is a voice inside my head

Could this be love  
That I hear calling  
Could this be love  
That I hear calling  
  
Got a fast education  
Holding you in tears  
Someone finally hurt you  
After all these years  
Got to get my message to you somehow  
  
Now you're lookin' in my eyes for courage  
Too late to think this through  
Baby  
There must be somethinbg we can do

Linda Ronstadt,Driftin',/l/linda+ronstadt/driftin_20696903.html,"Autumn  
The frost has come and kissed all the leaves to sleep forever  
Time sketches a few lines and etches its wishes into our lives  
See how everything's changing  
And see how time is rearranging the people and the places  
Keeping nothing sacred  
And like the leaves  
In the autumn wind  
We're driftin'  
  
We've been too many places  
We've seen too much  
Touched too many faces  
To think that there's just one way to love  
Or that there's just a day to love  
Somewhere some special moment in time and space  
(....) face to face  
But our lives are borrowed  
We love today and die tomorrow  
Like the leaves in the autumn wind  
We're driftin'  
  
I will always be grateful  
That time has granted us the right  
To be lovers if for just a moment  
We live in the (....) and we know it  
So if today is our last one  
Let's run out into the sun, ohh  
Love, hold onto my hand  
Hold on as long as you can  
For just like leaves in the autumn wind  
We're driftin'  
Just like leaves in the autumn wind

It's only when we stop it starts to hurt  
  
Going down for the first time  
Guess I've yet to learn loves ain't blind  
I could use a little help, I can't stay here by myself

Fires up my legs when he wants me to walk

Adds to my memory the things that people say  
When he makes decisions I don't have to wait  
But sometimes it seems he's got to much on his plate  
Like this morning when I woke up and he dressed me in this shirt  
That looks a little ragged where he drug me through the dirt  
I'm moving through this life and I'm thinking about the next  
And hoping when I get there I'll be better dressed  
Keeps my eyes open for most of the day

So so you think you can tell  
heaven from hell  
Blue skies from pain  
Can you tell a green field  
from a cold steel rail  
A smile from a veil  
do you think you can tell  
Did they get you to trade  
your heroes for ghosts  
Hot ashes for trees  
Hot air for a cool breeze  
Cold comfort for change  
Did you exchange  
A walk on part in the war  
for a lead role in the cage  
  
Whether you listenin' to hip hip-hop  
Or you tuning to rock  
Refugees on your box  
We gonna take over ya blocks  
  
Lets go  
How I wish, how I wish you were here  
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl  
Year after year  
Runnin' over the same old ground  
What have we found the same old fears  
Wish you were here  
  
Whether you listenin' to rock  
Or pumpin' the hip hip hop  
Refugees on your box  
  
Critics don't mistake this for just any cover tune  
I'ma take y'all to the dark side of the moon  
Kickin' in my moms room this song was just a thought  
A young refugee labeled, just come with a passport  
Dad used to tell me about the American dream  
My dream was waking up the projects  
A young teen listening to hip hop  
My brother tune me into rock  
Put me up on pink floyd and banned from the british blocks  
  
Whether you pumpin' the hip hip hop  
Or you tuning to rock  
Refugees on your box  
We gonna take over the blocks  
From n.j to bk to the u.k

Arrogant Worms,Celine Dion,/a/arrogant+worms/celine+dion_20009346.html,"I think I've got a crush on Celine Dion  
The way she beats her chest when she sings a love song  
There's something about her makes me want to feed her  
And I'd love to be Mister Celine Dion  
She'll sing a song in English, and she'll sing en francais  
Both the songs will suck, but I love her anyway  
She's full of emotion, I'm full of devotion  
For Celine and I'll be hers someday  
Oh Celine Dion, you soft-rock my world  
Won't you please be mine Celine  
I would do anything, if you'd be my girl  
Oh, be my girl Celine  
I sent you cards and letters, but you don't respond  
You play hard to get, but my heart goes on and on (and on and on, etc...)  
I just wanna say, je aimerez  
And I can see your house from my van  
Oh Celine Dion, you soft-rock my world  
Won't you please be mine Celine  
I would do anything, if you'd be my girl  
Oh, be my girl Celine  
Celine Celine  
Her skin's so soft and clean  
Just like porcelain  
I wish she'd slather me  
With a tub of Vaseline  
(That was a little creepy) I'm sorry, Celine

I won't feel better 'til I'm walking out of that door  
Once you could stop me  
Now I can say you won't  
I will be going

Know how I'm gonna get away from you  
And I know I'm never gonna stay with you  
Don't want to ever spend another day with you  
Look at the damage you've done  
Two can turn back into one  
You hurt me so much  
You'll never do that again  
It's time to leave you  
This has to come to an end  
But I don't know how I'm gonna get away from you  
And I know I'm never gonna stay with you  
Don't think there's any other way to say to you

Caught in the concertina

Break her regulations  
You watch her legs through several

With the company you're part of  
And you do the dirty business  
With your latest sleeping partner  
  
You're becoming  
Automatic

Out playing with the traffic  
  
You want attention  
You try my patience  
With the best intentions you are nothing but a nuisance  
  
Busy bodies  
Busy busy  
Getting nowhere  
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere  
  
Now you've given your performance  
Though the matinee was idle  
And you find that a wave of her right hand  
Could seem so tidal  
  
Just a second  
Satisfaction  
Busy bodies  
Temporarily out of action  
  
You wash and brush up  
You want to dress up  
You want to kiss her  
But she's busy with her makeup  
  
Busy bodies  
Very busy  
Getting nowhere  
Nowhere [x6]

Earth stood  
Hard as iron  
Water like a stone  
Snow had fallen  
Snow on snow  
Snow on snow  
In the bleak midwinter  
Long ago  
  
Our god  
Heaven cannot hold him  
Nor earth sustain  
Heaven and Earth  
Shall flee away  
When he comes to reign  
In the bleak midwinter  
A stable place sufficed  
The lord God almighty  
Jesus Christ  
  
Angels and archangels  
May have gathered there  
Cherubim and seraphim  
Thronged the air  
But his mother only  
In her maiden bliss  
Worshiped the beloved  
With a kiss  
  
What can I give him  
Poor as I am?  
If I were a shepherd  
I would bring a lamb  
If I were a wise man  
I would do my part  
Yet  
What I can I give him  
Give my heart

Beat them until there's nothing  
Get used to it  
Next thing the line is gone

Are we going down?  
Are we going down?  
Are we going down?  
Are we going down?  
Are we going down?

What you're missing  
Personally I'm sick of the ass kissing  
What I'm kicking to you won't get rotation  
Nowhere in the nation  
Program directors and DJ's ignored me  
Cause I simply said fuck Top Forty  
And top thirty top twenty and top ten  
Until you put more hip hop in  
Then I might grin but don't pretend that you're down with the see  
And go and dis me in a magazine  
How could you figure the brother could dig ya  
DJ face down in the river  
No it's not a threat but a promise  
I'm as  
Crazy as they come see  
Mama didn't love me  
All I got is my nine  
And to calm the savage beast here's the Alpine  
  
Turn off that bullshit!  
Turn off that motherfucking radio!  
Turn off that bullshit!  
Turn off that motherfucking radio!  
Turn off that bullshit!  
Play the music motherfucker put the music on  
Damn!  
  
Tune in to the radio listen for a minute  
Yo G stick a fucking tape in it  
Cause all the radio do is gangle  
That R and B love triangle  
If you're out there kicking it with the brothers  
You don't care about lovers  
You want to hear a young nigga on the mic  
Going buck wild  
Throwing and flowing and showing new styles  
That's where I'm coming from  
Reality that's what they're running from  
So if you're down with Ice Cube let me know that you know  
Yo turn off the radio  
  
You know what? You know what?  
Basically those black guys and those rap guys  
They don't know what the fuck they're doing  
I hate those fuckers  
I hate em  
Especially that one guy  
The AmeriKKKa's most wanted  
Ice Cube, I hate that fucker  
Get him off the air, get him off, get him off  
Get that rap shit out of here!  
Just get me a gat so I can smoke this motherfucker!

Sound of breaking hearts around  
Oh you know, we're burning in desire  
City of the lost and found  
In a world of broken dreams  
We will build a better life  
You're my Venus in blue jeans  
Only the strong survive  
So come on baby, come on baby  
  
Dreams are made  
Made of deep emotion  
Love will feed a brand new world

Living in a better world  
There's a heavy weather girl  
The clouds disappear  
The masquerade of loneliness  
Is drowning too much tears  
Come on baby, come on baby

this thing and that thing my felo man  
I guess i'll let you know when I figure it out

Grateful Dead,Ship Of Fools,/g/grateful+dead/ship+of+fools_20062384.html,"Went to see the captain, strangest I could find,  
Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line.  
I won't slave for beggar's pay, likewise gold and jewels,  
But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools.  
  
Ship of fools on a cruel sea, ship of fools sail away from me.  
It was later than I thought when I first believed you,  
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.  
  
Saw your first ship sink and drown, from rockin' of the boat,  
And all that could not sink or swim was just left there to float.  
I won't leave you drifting down, but woh it makes me wild,  
With thirty years upon my head to have you call me child.  
  
Ship of fools on a cruel sea, ship of fools sail away from me.  
It was later than I thought when I first believed you,  
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.  
  
The bottles stand as empty, as they were filled before.  
Time there was and plenty, but from that cup no more.  
Though I could not caution all, I still might warn a few:  
Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools.  
  
Ship of fools on a cruel sea, ship of fools sail away from me.  
It was later than I thought, when I first believed you,  
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

Procol Harum,Look To Your Soul,/p/procol+harum/look+to+your+soul_20111581.html,"I know if I'd been wiser this would never have occurred  
But I wallowed in my blindness so it's plain that I deserve  
For the sin of self-indulgence when the truth was writ quite clear  
I must spend my life amongst the dead who spend their lives in fear  
Of a death that they're not sure of, of a life they can't control  
It's all so simple really if you just look to your soul  
  
Some say that I'm a wise man, some think that I'm a fool  
It doesn't matter either way: I'll be a wise man's fool  
For the lesson lies in learning and by teaching I'll be taught  
For there's nothing hidden anywhere, it's all there to be sought  
And so if you know anything look closely at the time  
At others who remain untrue and don't commit that crime

They never said your name but i know just who they meant  
  
Woa woa  
I was so surprised and shocked and wondered too  
If by chance you heard it for yourself?  
I never told a soul just how i've been feeling over you  
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air

On the radio oh oh oh  
On the radio oh oh oh...now now  
  
Don't it kind of strike you sad when you hear our song  
Things are not the same since we broke up last june  
The only thing that i want to hear is it that you love me still  
And that you think, you'll be coming home real soon  
  
Woho yeah it kinda' made me feel proud when i heard him say  
You couldn't find the words to say yourself  
And now in my heart i know i can say what i really feel  
'Cause they said it really loud they said it on the air

If you think that love isn't found on on the radio  
Then tune right in you may find the love you lost  
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the girl i sent away long ago

Rod Stewart,I Wouldn't Ever Change A Thing,/r/rod+stewart/i+wouldnt+ever+change+a+thing_20117373.html,"I wouldn't change a thing if I could live it all again  
  
Ah listen  
It's funny you know when you sit down  
And think about what you had  
About the friends you used to know  
What happened, where did they all go  
Can you remember happy hours  
Spent drinkin' and thinkin'  
We thought we could change the world  
And we never, never, never, never, never  
Never thought we could get much older then  
  
We were the ones who loved to love the right to love  
We'd bring it on home with the right song  
Played at the right time  
What happened to the girl that you loved once and left  
Young man did you break her heart  
Did she live, and did she marry,  
Did she ever think on your face again  
Ah now hold on a minute  
  
I wouldn't change a thing if I could live it all again  
Ah yeah  
  
I think what you say is all so right  
But I find it hard to jog my memories  
Don't worry Lou you may never get another chance yeah  
  
Yes I think what you say is all so right  
But I find it hard to move my memories  
Say it again with a lot more feelin'  
  
And I think what you say is all so right  
But I find it hard to find my memories  
Don't sing so serious you make me feel so sad  
  
But if I was true to myself  
I would probably find it was a tear in my eye  
That stopped me from believing you  
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry don't worry  
  
You know my tongue gets tired  
When I think back on all of the things we do  
But I wonder if I'll remember these few precious things  
As years pass me by  
Ah when young bodies that've grown older  
And mind's become dimmer  
I'll point the finger back in time  
  
I said I wouldn't change a thing if I could  
If I could, if I could live it all again, yeah

Offspring,What Happened To You?,/o/offspring/what+happened+to+you_20102678.html,"Before you started tokin  
You used to have a brain  
But now you don't get even the simplest of things  
I can draw a little picture  
  
Or even use my hands  
I try to explain but you just don't understand  
Man you're really losin' it  
And you've really done a lot of junk now  
  
But you keep abusin' it  
What in the world happened to you  
It's bad enough you do it to yourself  
But taking someone with you well you know that's something else  
  
I say I'm not that kind of person  
I'm not that kind of man  
I try to explain but you just don't understand  
I might be sympathetic or cut a little slack  
  
If I thought that you were willing to give a little back  
But you do it in the morning  
You do it in the night  
You lie to refrain from just facing your life  
  
So I'll see you man tomorrow  
You'll be gackin' up again  
I'll see you in a coffin by the time your wad is spent  
I think of all the times that I tried to lend a hand  
  
I try to explain but you just don't understand

LL Cool J,The Breakthrough,/l/ll+cool+j/the+breakthrough_20081048.html,"Knuckleheads spreadin' gossip all over town  
Every time I drive by you're just standin' around  
Hundred-bottles in your pocket, forty-dog in your hand  
Don't you know you're just a worker and your boss is my man?  
L.L. this, L.L. that, soon as I walk in the place  
I want to take my gun and shoot you in your muthafuckin' face  
You're playin' me too close with the schemin' and games  
I guess the beef and the bullshit is the price of fame  
Movies, records, goin' on tour  
Twenty-thousand people hip-hoppin' on the floor  
Whole parties body-rockin', and everything's chill  
Get back to New York, and the suckers act ill  
See I fought with the devil, made a promise to God  
I have experience in goin' all the way to the top  
It's harder harder than hard  
All the suckers are barred  
You used to try to talk down now your ego is scarred  
See the problem is you want what another man has  
His car, his wife, or his razzamatazz  
But that's weak, you gotta do work on your own  
Cause when you're rich you got friends  
But when you're poor you're alone  
So get your own on your own, it'll strengthen your soul  
Stop livin' off your parents like you're three years old  
Instead of walkin' like you're limp and talkin' yang about me  
Why don't you take your monkey-ass and get a college degree?  
Or write a rhyme and ride a bike and try to live carefree  
Hope my message reaches you before you're seventy-three  
A old man, when people ask you what you did with your life  
You'll say ""I hated L.L. and I carried a big knife""  
Every day is a chase, every day is a race  
And every day you're being overpowered by my bass  
Too much juice to be a deuce, I had to be a ace  
It's like the fire's in my eyes and the gun's in my face  
I'm stompin' stupid knuckleheads until they bleed  
I'm the leader of the show, so it's up to me to lead  
I'ma lead you away from drugs and petty crime  
Lead you away from wack beats and rhyme  
Lead you to that ticket line  
So you can come in my show and watch the stars shine  
Get busy, not dizzy, want to teach the young  
The last man who didn't listen ended up gettin' hung  
Not that I killed him, it's just  
He didn't want to trust  
The words of a master that's why you must  
Take heed to the speech, it's gonna reach your ear  
Don't try to say you can't hear 'cause the words are clear  
Throwin' flurries, punks scurry and I bury the rest  
You better hurry up and rock a rhyme and give it your best  
Cause tonight's the night we gonna see the big fight  
Twelve-gauge on the stage in case it don't go right  
E-Love drives a tank, he's strong like a truck  
If you're cryin' while you're dyin' we ain't givin' a fuck  
L.L. Cool J is on the microphone  
Tellin' all you punk ducks ""Leave me the hell alone""  
Cause I'm rated X, born to snap necks  
Straight up and down, no special effects  
I'm the professor, the teacher, the hip-hop dean  
If Russia bombed the U.S., they'd be scared to touch Queens  
Cause that's where I live, and this is what I give  
Turnin' top-notch crews into fugitives  
They run, they frightened, they hide from King Titan  
Like a sniper when he's shootin' or a viper when he's bitin'  
Here I am, tellin' the truth  
And I'm spreadin' the word to my fellow youth  
It goes man-to-man and jam-to-jam  
I got hip-hop, rock, and love song fans  
All you petty MC's in the state of New York  
Gettin' a thousand for a show but you still want to squawk  
Can't get a decent contract, your beats ain't workin'  
Dogged-out Pumas plus you're manager's jerkin'  
Your mic sounds weak, remember that sieezer  
I'm badder than Napoleon, Hitler or Caesar  
I'm a hit man, but I'm not for hire  
Fly girl's desire, the man you admire  
Not only on the stage, I rock in the park  
And I'm a killer in the daytime, and worse after dark  
So don't never ever mess with the king of the sound  
L.L. Cool J, the baddest around.

They're tearing it down now  
But it's just as well  
I haven't shown you everything a man can do  
So stay with me baby  
I've got plans for you  
  
This is the time to remember  
Cause it will not last forever  
These are the days  
To hold on to  
Cause we won't  
Although we'll want to  
This is the time  
But time is gonna change  
You've given me the best of you  
And now I need the rest of you  
  
Did you know that before you came into my life  
It was some kind of miracle that I survived  
Some day we will both look back  
And have to laugh  
We lived through a lifetime  
And the aftermath  
  
This is the time to remember  
Cause it will not last forever  
These are the days  
To hold on to  
Cause we won't  
Although we want to  
This is the time  
But time is gonna change  
I know we've got to move somehow  
But I don't want to lose you know  
  
Sometimes it's so easy  
To let a day  
Slip on by  
Without even seeing each other at all  
But this is the time you'll turn back and so will I  
And those will be the days you can never recall  
  
And so we embrace again  
Behind the dunes  
This beach is cold  
On winter afternoons  
But holding you close is like holding the summer sun  
I'm warm from the memory of days to come  
  
This is the time to remember  
Cause it will not last forever  
These are the days  
To hold on to  
But we won't  
Although we'll want to  
This is the time  
But time is gonna change  
You've given me the best of you  
But now I need the rest of you

Could it be that I feel so all alone  
It's you that's driving me mad  
You won't leave me alone  
  
You have touched my soul  
You have touched my soul  
Now hear me  
  
Could it be that you feel so all alone?  
If it's me that's driving you mad,  
Oh, I would leave you alone  
Oh yes I would.

He was at his best when the going was rough  
He made a living for the family and never had to cheat  
To keep food on the table and shoes on our feet  
  
We sat down at the table and thanked god in prayer  
Cause we had plenty to eat and plenty to wear  
We had patches on our britches but momma kept us neat  
We had food on the table and shoes on our feet  
  
We picked the cotton and gathered the corn  
We were taught to work from the day we were born  
Mom and dad and all us children worked in the summer's heat  
To keep food on the table and shoes on our feet  
  
When you sit down at the table thank god in prayer  
If you've got plenty to eat and plenty to wear  
If you've got patches on your britches just be sure to keep em neat

As good as lost but you know the way  
Through the faceless town  
And she pulls me down  
  
I know the place and the time (of our lives)  
So long ago  
And all through the years (never dies)  
All things must pass  
  
Irresistible force meets an immovable object and  
Human animal madness and blood starts to flow  
Invisible fingers and indescribable pleasure

I get to find my personal god  
  
God of love, god of gold  
Ring of fire in the days of old  
It's what I'm living for and love's the only law  
So answer Mayday, S.O.S.  
Search me North, East, South, or West  
It's all I miss, just the one last kiss  
  
This is goodbye to the days (of our lives)  
My fair-weather friend  
I feel your sorrow and tears (they are mine)  
I share to the end

Human animal magic  
How far can you go?  
The rolling of thunder and,  
You decide what you're after  
  
I get to find my personal god  
I get to find my personal god  
  
I surrender  
All or nothing  
You must spread your wings and fly

Mary Black,Dockland,/m/mary+black/dockland_20089962.html,"Late glow on an early winter evening in Dockland  
With my ship of dreams moving easily across the sound  
Reminiscence is weighing me down with a vengeance  
Tide water so deep I think I'm going to drown  
  
But in the wink of an eye I am rising above the affliction  
In the wink of an eye I am come back in from the cold  
I don't even have to try and I'm gone out of here without notice  
Gone out of Dockland without a care in the world  
  
It didn't hit me when I met you coming out of the shambles  
It didn't hit me when you took me to the summer field  
I didn't flinch when you told me that you'd get what you wanted  
I never had what it takes to have a heart of steel  
  
But in the wink of an eye I am rising above the affliction  
In the wink of an eye I am come back in from the cold

I'm gone out Dockland without a care in the world  
Gone out of Dockland  
  
Yes, I loved you the time that is was  
And yes, you may rip me whenever you want  
  
So it goes on a crystal-clear morning in Dockland  
And heaven knows if I'll ever live to love again  
Struck down by the kiss of an angel in limbo  
Laid low by the act of the going  
  
But in the wink of an eye I am rising above the affliction  
In the wink of an eye I am come back in from the cold  
I don't even have to try and I'm gone out of here without notice  
Gone out of Dockland without a care in the world

You gotta be cool  
And if you deny it,  
Then baby you're a fool.  
I'm telling you now,  
Don't you hide it away.  
Because you need to keep you warm both night and day.  
  
I could come home  
Late at night  
And after some loving,  
Baby, it would be alright.  
I've given up trying  
Lying my way.  
Because you need love to keep you warm both night and day,  
You gotta have love to keep you warm both night and day.  
  
I said baby, if you need my love  
You better come home with me.  
Maybe if you want my love,  
You know you got it easily.  
But, when the sun goes down  
And the night is cold,  
You know I won't be far away.  
Because you need love to keep you warm both night and day,  
You gotta have love to keep you warm both night and day.  
  
You gotta have love  
  
If you want schooling baby  
I'll be around,  
I'm ready for fooling  
But, don't hang around.  
And every morning I know I will say.  
Because you need love to keep you warm both night and day,  
You gotta have love to keep you warm both night and day.

And so it continued both day, and night

A prisoner of darkness, I let you down my friend

Till I leave this world, always know that

Oh our love doesn't end here, it lives forever on the wings of time  
  
The road that I travel, don't know which way I should turn  
Till I find the answer, know that the fire within me will always burn  
  
Angel of mercy, please, why so much pain?  
I cry for forgiveness, I'm the destitute man  
Who still remains, it's so hard to explain  
Till I leave this world, always know that  
  
Sometimes I feel just like crying  
I can't turn my back, all these years I've been trying  
A vision of you keeps reappearing to me  
You can't blame yourself, just reach out your hand and believe  
  
We sail in dark waters, Lord give me some peace of mind  
Temptation before me, ahead lies the tower of truth that I must find  
To you I will climb  
Till I leave this cruel world far behind, always know that

Stuck inside a wheel, inside a wheel  
Wondering everyday is it all for real  
Blinking every time a cold wind blow  
Our love don't fill a mile in rose  
  
Danger remains  
Wat ya gonna do when the old man reads you dry  
Step down from the plane and pluck the eye  
Slide in deeper closer to the bone  
Don't you just wish your heart was made of stone?  
  
Waxing like an old crack 45  
Counting out the ways you could stay alive  
Placing all the banks and feel the stones  
My love won't leave her ways of foam

Waterboys,"Further Up, Further In",/w/waterboys/further+up+further+in_20145325.html,"I dreamed the wind came to my house  
These are the words fell from his mouth  
""The King you seek you'll find him true  
But only if he rides the road with you""  
I stepped aboard a ship that flew  
It took me to wherever it wanted to  
Far above the land, far above the sea  
The dreamer and the doer agreed to agree  
I was sent to the war, stripped of my power  
Gagged and imprisoned in a tall dark tower  
I must have cried for an age or more  
'till I saw through tears and I found the door  
High on a cliff, in gorgeous clothes  
A madman danced on the balls of his toes  
Forgetting myself I fell at the feet  
Of the greatest Fool I ever did meet  
The stars were bright and magic afoot  
On the Summer wind rose the sound of a flute  
I saw the musician - my heart knew him well  
What happens next, no rhyme can tell  
We came to the end of the world one day  
A dolphin swan in a sheltered bay  
I paid to the King what it was I owed,  
Put my face to the wind and my foot on the road  
I find I've wandered far from home  
But home is in me wherever I roam  
I thought I was an hour or a year behind  
But the hours and the years are only time

While you lie alone in that idea-free sleep of yours  
That you've been sleeping now for years  
  
And he wants you  
He wants you  
He is straight and he is true  
Ooh hoo hoo  
  
Beneath the hanging cliffs and under the many stars where  
He will move, all amongst your tangled hair  
And deep into the sea  
And you will wake and walk and draw the blind  
And feel some presence there behind  
And turn to see what that may be  
Oh, babe, it's me  
  
And he wants you

All around her workers raised  
Golden idols to her smile  
The waiting years weren't hard to see  
Behind the tears of Mercury.  
  
She spoke of silver from the sky  
And many floating safety boats  
To pick them up when they would fly  
Far above their dreams and hopes  
And they a mountain city raised  
Where their queen above the clouds  
Could watch out.

From the biggest elephant  
To the smallest bird:

To pick them up when they would fly,

But their hearts are weary through and through  
And it's a long way into the light of the day  
While the jukebox and the radio play  
  
Where the days turn into the nights  
People move into the sounds and sights  
Like the moth is drawn into the lights  
Like the tight-rope walker into the heights  
It's in their hearts, it's in their hips,  
It's in their feet, it's on their lips  
  
Tonight's the night I'm gonna make you mine  
Gonna dance right out onto the edge of time  
When the sound starts pumpin'  
And the lights are flashin'  
And my hearts-a-thumpin'  
And I feel the passion  
And the world is right there waiting  
At my finger tips  
Disco... apocalypse  
  
In the dawn the city seems to sigh  
And the hungry hear their children cry  
People watch the time go by  
They do their jobs and live and die  
And in their dreams they rise above  
By strength, or hate, or luck, or love  
  
Tonight's the night I'm gonna make you mine  
Gonna dance right out onto the edge of time  
When the world starts turnin'  
And the dreams are burnin'  
And the skies awaken  
Through the wind and the fire  
They will be dancing still  
  
It's in their hearts, it's in their hips,  
It's in their feet, it's on their lips  
A single sound that never ends  
They die each night and live again  
  
I'm gonna make you mine  
Tonight's the night  
Out on the edge of time  
With the dreams of flesh and love dancing in my mind  
Dancing through the fire on the edge of time

To try and find  
What really happened  
To the love  
That we shared  
  
How could I be such a fool  
How could I believe  
All those lies you told me  
How could I be taken in  
By your sweet face  
You spoiled our love  
You ruined my life  
I'm so tore down  
I'm a terrible disgrace  
  
But there will come a time  
And you'll regret the way  
You treated me  
As if I was a fool  
And didn't know  
The many times you lied  
About your love for me  
Someone else is gonna know  
That your love was just a show

Where the cool fall nights make the woods smell right and the fox hunter blows
him horn  
I fell in love with a girl from the town, I thought that she would be true  
I ran away to Charlottsville and worked in a sawmill or two  
What have they done to the old home place?  
Why did they tear it down?  
And why did I leave the plow in the field and look for a job in the town?  
Now the girl ran off with somebody else, tariffs took all my pay  
And here I stand where the old home stood before they took it away  
Now geese fly south and the cold wind blows as I stand here and hang my head  
I lost my love and lost my home, and now I wish that I was dead

But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no  
Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider.  
  
And I've gone by the point of caring,  
Some old bed I'll soon be sharing,  
And I've got one more silver dollar,  
  
Repeat three times and Fade  
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no  
Not gonna let them catch the Midnight Rider.

Mariah Carey,Side Effects (Feat. Young Jeezy),/m/mariah+carey/side+effects+feat+young+jeezy_20736703.html,"(Young Jeezy):  
It's M.C. and Y.J.  
Another hit, okay  
We lookin' fine  
Takin' off  
Saw us on a runway  
On any given Sunday  
Monday, Tuesday  
They try to confuse me  
I never let 'em use me  
  
(Mariah Carey):  
I was a girl  
You was a man  
I was too young  
To understand  
I was naive  
I just believed  
Everything  
That you told me  
Said you were strong  
Protecting me  
Then I found out  
That you were weak  
Keepin' me there  
Under your thumb  
Cause you were scared  
That I'd become much  
More than you could handle  
Shining like a chandelier  
That decorated  
Every room inside  
The private hell we built  
And I dealt with it  
Like a kid  
I wished  
I could fly away  
  
But instead  
I kept my tears inside  
Cause I knew if I started  
I'd keep crying  
For the rest of my life  
With you  
I finally built up  
The strength to walk away  
Don't regret it  
But I still live  
With the side effects  
  
Wakin' up  
Scared some nights  
Still dreaming 'bout  
The violent times  
Still little protective  
'Bout the people  
That I let inside  
Still little defensive  
Thinkin' folk be  
Tryna run my life  
Still little  
Depressed inside  
I fake a smile and deal  
With the side effects  
(Oh, oh)  
Side effects  
(Oh, oh)  
Side effects  
(Oh, oh)  
Side effects  
(Oh, oh)  
  
It didn't stop  
No one was there  
Couldn't be real  
Had to keep quiet  
Once in awhile  
Put up a fight  
It's just too much  
Night after night  
After awhile  
I would just lie  
You was dead wrong  
Said you was right  
Did what I could  
Just to survive  
Couldn't believe  
This was my life  
Flickering like a candle  
Do my best to handle  
Sleeping with the enemy  
Whether he was smothering  
Every last part of me  
So I broke away  
And finally found  
The strength to leave  
  
Still kept the tears inside  
Cause I knew if I started  
I'd keep crying  
For the rest of my life  
With you  
I finally built up  
The strength to walk away  
Don't regret it  
But I still live

Hey Magnifico  
Or should I say  
Magnificent?  
Ain't nothing worth  
Your happiness  
And I ain't caring  
Who you're  
With misery love company  
So we ain't tryin'  
To hang with y'all  
Hurt you

Gotta keep ya  
Sucka smilin'  
Keep tryin' to play

Loneliness  
How is this?  
I think the call

What can you  
Prescribe for this?  
  
(Mariah) (2x):  
Forgive but I can't forget  
Every day I deal with this  
I live  
With the side efffects  
But I ain't gonna let them  
Get the best of me  
  
Kept my tears inside

Vertical Horizon,Prayer For An Innocent Man,/v/vertical+horizon/prayer+for+an+innocent+man_20144025.html,"Oh won't you listen O Lord to my plea for justice  
Can't you hear my cry for help  
Try to heed my honest prayer  
And judge me in my favor  
  
'Cause you know my heart  
You have come to me at night  
But it's so hard to speak no evil  
In a hole deprived of light  
  
So I pray for you to answer  
And to turn to me and smile  
Shower me with love to save me  
From demons deep inside  
  
Protect me as you would your own eyes  
In the shadows of your wings  
And learn to know the sound that echoes  
When an innocent man sings  
When an innocent man sings  
When he sings  
  
So I lie with all my failures  
Praying to my best friend's ghost  
Time to kneel instead of sitting  
And let me do thy bidding  
Won't you let me do thy bidding yeah  
Help me do thy bidding

But by the time you catch them  
Simplicity's gone  
So we sort through the pieces

Searching through the darkness to find  
The breaks in the sky

Kills the maiden

Writing you this letter that you'll probably never see  
  
But I can't help but be  
Ruled by inconsistency  
Not unique just distantly in love  
  
Tried to phone from Paris thinking  
Things could be arranged  
Me and you could rendezvous  
But I found your number changed  
So I drove to San Remo where  
The crazy painter dwells  
And toasted our old photographs  
Still up there on his shelf  
  
But I can't help but be  
Ruled by my antiquity  
Not unique just distantly in love  
I can't be the one to fill  
Your times and all your places  
I can't be the one to fill  
Your blanks and empty spaces  
  
I heard it from a friend of ours  
I saw in Timber Bay  
That you had a new lover who had  
Stolen you away  
That could be be the reason that  
I never got in touch  
And may present slight problems  
If he loves you half as much  
  
But I can't help but be  
Ruled by inconsistency  
Not unique just distantly in love  
  
As I who can't help but be  
Ruled by my antiquity  
Not unique just distantly in love  
You know I can't help but be  
Part of my own philosophy  
Not unique just distantly in love

Bruce Springsteen,Jungleland,/b/bruce+springsteen/jungleland_20025021.html,"The Rangers had a homecoming  
In Harlem late last night  
And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine  
Over the Jersey state line  
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge  
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain  
The Rat pulls into town, rolls up his pants  
Together they take a stab at romance  
And disappear down Flamingo Lane  
  
Well, the Maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo  
Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl  
And the kids 'round there live just like shadows  
Always quiet, holding hands  
From the churches to the jails  
Tonight all is silence in the world  
As we take our stand  
Down in Jungleland  
  
The midnight gang's assembled  
And picked a rendezvous for the night  
They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign  
That brings this fair city light  
Man, there's an opera out on the Turnpike  
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley  
Until the local cops, Cherry-Tops, rips this holy night  
The street's alive as secret debts are paid  
Contacts made, they flash unseen  
Kids flash guitars just like switchblades  
Hustling for the record machine  
The hungry and the hunted  
Explode into rock 'n' roll bands  
That face off against each other out in the street  
Down in Jungleland  
  
In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage  
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the DJ plays  
Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners  
Desperate as the night moves on  
Just one look and a whisper, and they're gone  
  
Beneath the city, two hearts beat  
Soul engines running through a night so tender  
In a bedroom locked in whispers  
Of soft refusal and then surrender  
In the tunnels uptown, the Rat's own dream guns him down  
As shots echo down them hallways in the night  
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away  
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light  
  
Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz  
Between what's flesh and what's fantasy  
And the poets down here don't write nothing at all  
They just stand back and let it all be  
And in the quick of a knife, they reach for their moment  
And try to make an honest stand  
But they wind up wounded, not even dead  
Tonight in Jungleland

Past your chin to Africa  
Once more to the she-lion's den  
Where I was at home back then  
Inbetween your tender long legs  
Searching snow from just last year  
Never does the snow appear  
Let me ride out on a tear  
In the clouds there is no bliss  
A big bird gently slides his head  
Back into a secret crevice  
Inbetween your tender long legs  
Searching sand from just last year  
Never does the sand appear  
Hunger connects  
Just like an insect  
Asleep you never sense  
Right as it bites  
Nowhere can it be good so  
The finger slips to Mexico  
Then down it sinks into the sea  
Hunger has no mercy

Shoved out on the railroad track

And I had nowhere to run  
But I stood and looked  
And my eyes got hooked  
On that beautiful morning sun

Yeah and the grass is oh so green  
And my heart is still and I've got the will  
And I don't really feel so mean

And it comes right in on time  
Well it eases me and it pleases me  
And it satisfies my mind

Wonder why we try at all  
You wonder why the world is turning around  
When in the end it won't matter at all  
  
Standing in the town  
Looking at people, counting their frowns  
Unhappy faces, hurrying around  
So blind they cannot see  
All of these things  
The way life ought to be  
And with tomorrow what will they make of me

Somebody lit a cigarette

Backbreaking pickers in the patches  
Everythings burning down to ashes  
And down to the ground

Lighting and leaving  
And there's tea leaves tossing  
Heads up pennies in my pocket

Then days so still the beauty gives you pain  
The heatwave kills the green  
And she remains unseen  
But colors up my dreams  
With all things blooming

It's not a kingdom  
It's not an angry god

It feels like no fear  
It feels like no doubt  
It feels like inside out

Last nights dream unravels

Answer right now  
Just to tell you once again  
Who's bad

You're doin' wrong  
Gonna lock you up  
Before too long  
Your lyin' eyes  
Gonna tell you right  
So listen up  
Don't make a fight  
Your talk is cheap  
You're not a man  
You're throwin' stones  
To hide your hands

My sword, hands held high  
Together we stem the tide  
And

Let it roar- let the lion in you raise its head and roar  
Let it roar- let the lion in you come right out and roar  
Burning the street's on fire  
Pounding, the blood runs red  
In power we call to arms  
Rising a million strong  
[Chorus]  
Cry out, life's a struggle but it's worth the price  
With fists of fire we can melt the ice  
Behold the king who wears the crown of hate  
I think we're gonna break him!  
Listen, the devil won't be coming here today  
Even death can take an holiday  
Shout it loud 'cross the land  
Freedom is alive now!  
Roar!!!

Roar, roar, roar- together  
Roar, roar, roar- I can't hear ya  
Roar, roar, roar- let it...

Extreme,Cynical,/e/extreme/cynical_20179039.html,"Today don't look so bad, compared to tomorrow.  
If time is all we have, then we're living on borrowed.  
Yesterday's for fools who try to remember.  
The good old days weren't always that much better.  
  
Cynical.  
Well, I ain't nothing but a Cynical.  
It don't take much to be a Cynical.  
All you need is love.  
All you need is what to be a...  
  
And whatever you do, someone's done it first.  
Though it's sad but true, this is just another verse.  
If you can't take it with you, then what's the use?  
I never saw a you-haul being pulled behind a hearse.  
  
Looks like my brighter side has gotten a bit darker.  
I must have stepped over my 4-leaf clover.  
'cause someone drank my half-filled cup of water.

And now I gotta move on  
I've gotta catch up to the world  
Even though I gave you my life  
As wrong as it seems I know it's right  
But is there a place that I can go away  
To escape the love that I will forever know  
  
Where can we go from here?  
All I know is that I love you still  
Sometimes we do things against our will  
I know I cry lonely tears  
Where can we go from here?  
  
Why, Why do I cry inside?  
When love is gone away  
And how, How can I carry on  
When I know all the love is gone  
Tell me where can I go to get away?  
From the pain of loving you  
Tell me where

Across the canyon wall  
The cattle are quiet and still  
Dusty, sore and tired  
I build myself a fire  
As a full moon  
Peaks over the hills.  
  
A blanket for my bed  
A saddle for my head  
I'll sleep  
But in my dreams I'll stray  
Back across the miles  
To where my darlin' smiles  
In memories of old Santa Fe.  
  
Adios mi corinyo  
She told me that day  
As I kissed her softly  
And then rode away.  
Now I lie beneath the stars  
Without her in my arms  
So lonesome  
And so far away  
But each night  
I go back there  
In my dreams  
And in my prayers  
And in memories of old Santa Fe.  
  
Adios mi corinyo  
She told me that day  
As I kissed her softly  
And then rode away.

But for now  
All I can hold  
Are my memories  
Of old Sata Fe

We were lost in the moment  
Seems like we can't find

Could we surrender together  
Somewhere to begin again

When everything goes away  
To remind us how ungrateful our culture is  
We need to take time  
To replace what's stolen from Mother Nature

Grass won't be green and the sky won't be blue  
I don't wanna see a cyclone  
There's no sun, no moon, no me, no you

And there's no going back  
The loneliness calls him  
And the edge which must be sharpened

But there's a fighter in his mind and his body's tough  
The years have been unkind but kind enough  
  
The smell of the earth  
It's his favourite smell  
But he's somehow compelled to the stinging salt hell  
To the place where he hurts and he's scared  
And there's no one to tell  
And no one who doesn't listen

Like silk drawn across my neck

Your tender voice riding on the sea spray

A storm..

In between the points of light  
Between two distant shorelines

It's time to stand up and fight

To the motherland  
  
One by one we're gonna stand with the pride  
One that can't be denied  
(Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up)  
From the highest mountain and valley low  
We'll join together with hearts of gold  
  
Now the children of the world can see  
There's a better way for us to be  
The place where mankind was born  
Is so neglected and torn, torn apart  
  
Every woman, every man  
Join the caravan of love (Stand up, stand up, stand up)  
Everybody take a stand  
Join the caravan of love  
  
I'm your brother  
I'm your brother, don't you know  
I'm your brother  
I'm your brother, don't you know  
  
We'll be living in a world of peace  
In a day when everyone is free  
We'll bring the young and the old  
Won't you let your love flow from your heart  
  
Every woman, every man  
Join the caravan of love (Stand up, stand up, stand up)  
Everybody take a stand  
Join the caravan of love  
  
I'm your brother  
I'm your brother, don't you know  
I'm your brother  
I'm your brother, don't you know  
  
Now the children of the world can see  
There's a better for us to be  
The place where mankind was born  
Is so neglected and torn, torn apart

Join the caravan of love (Stand up, stand up, stand up)  
Everybody take a stand  
Join the caravan of love  
  
Are you ready for the time of your life  
(Are you ready, are you ready)  
Are you ready for the time of your life  
(Are you ready, are you ready)  
  
Come go with me  
(Are you ready, are you ready)  
Come go with me

Reba Mcentire,If I Could Live Your Life,/r/reba+mcentire/if+i+could+live+your+life_20114612.html,"You jet from coast to coast  
Dressed in designer clothes  
When you appear somewhere  
Your chauffeur drives you there  
I would think twice  
If I could live your life  
  
You see your friends at the store  
Your sister lives next door  
You kiss your babies goodnight  
Your husbands there at your side  
I'd love to give it a try  
If I could live your life  
  
If I could trade places with you  
Hear the roar of the crowd  
And the church bells in a quiet town  
Just for one moment in time  
I wonder what this world would be like  
If I could live your life  
  
Saw your picture in 'People' today  
And I see you're in PTA  
Your livin' everyone's dream  
It isn't all that it seems  
Wouldn't it all be nice

Kris Kristofferson,Silver,/k/kris+kristofferson/silver_10160184.html,"Silver was a rounder with a wicked reputation  
Music was his magic and his madness rolled in one  
It's said he charmed the fairest hearts of this world's fairest maidens  
  
Quick as silver mercury and slippery as a song  
  
Winding like a river through a thirsty world of strangers  
Carving out a legend in a dream-forsaken land  
Silver took his pleasures just as freely as he gave them  
'cause hungry eyes weren't quick enough for silver's flashing hands  
  
Then once upon escaping from the world of silk and shadows  
Sudden growin' sicker of the secrets and the shame  
He stumbled onto something real that beckoned like a candle  
And never lookin' backwards, he surrendered to the flame  
  
Chorus:  
Because hunger, is the surface, of a darkened pool of sadness  
Silver pale reflection of a deeper need below  
Mystery and magic are the holy forms of madness  
Sacred as the ecstasy that slumbers in your soul  
  
Silver moved instinctively within her soft defenses  
Soon unfolding mysteries he'd never seen before  
And wakening an ancient need, she slipped inside his senses  
And silver took it easy as the closing of a door  
  
Then soon he touched the secret fears she'd hidden with her sorrows  
Darker than her raven hair and deeper than her eyes  
And dared to try to lead her to the sunlight from her shadows  
Following the line between her laughter and her lies  
  
But silver left his magic with the legend he'd abandoned  
Love had stripped him naked of illusion and it's charms  
Then one long night her changing mind took kindly to a stranger  
And morning found her moving in the golden stranger's arms  
  
Chorus:  
Because hunger, is the surface, of a darkened pool of sadness  
Silver pale reflection of a deeper need below  
Mystery and magic are the holy forms of madness  
Sacred as the ecstasy that slumbers in your soul  
  
Silver stared in silence at the tangled scene before him  
Time was burning frozen in the oceans of his eyes  
And sadly turning backwards to the world that he'd forsaken  
He donned the shining mantle of deception and disguise  
  
Slowly, with the patience born of silent desperation  
Silver worked his way into the darkness of her mind  
Weaving through her conscience like a chance she might have taken  
Sadder than the shadows of the love she'll never find  
  
And silver's spell was stronger than the softly smiling stranger  
Whose star was burning smaller in the naked light of day  
And silver took her hand again, a wiser man, but sadder  
Ready for the stranger who would steal her love away  
  
Chorus:  
Because hunger, is the surface, of a darkened pool of sadness  
Silver pale reflection of a deeper need below  
Mystery and magic are the holy forms of madness  
Sworn to free the ecstasy that slumbers in your soul

To burn a naked light  
Just to defy the night

In fumble bumble town  
Our lives a ruin  
We reconstruct a bit  
And pretty up a bit  
We hardly know what we're doing

Make the best of this world

Innocent girl

Writing on the wall, cities may fall  
  
Back through the city fog  
I was another cog  
For the machinery there  
Now the machines have gone  
The silence hanging on  
I sit, I stare

Come on and take your aim  
I feel the mildest pain  
Protecting something so rare  
'Cause there's a gem or two  
Inside the human zoo  
If only you are aware

If you wanna dream, be a dreamer

Every thing you do is gonna add up  
It's what you asked for, so  
Don't get mad when it's not what you thought  
  
Careful now girl with them Jezebel ways  
Fell on your head, but you're queen of cliches  
Little one playing with the big boys now

A generation to behold  
Lighting fires with our words  
Instead of useless smoke that blurs

Expression that lives on  
An army with a song  
That lingers when we're gone  
I had a dream  
  
If you wanna preach, be a preacher  
If you wanna teach, be a teacher  
Remember that the footprints you're leaving  
Will tell us all who you really are  
  
It's too bad you can't see what you're worth  
Spreading your legs instead of using your words  
Character is shown by the things that we do  
The one thing you're never gonna hide is the truth  
  
'Cause anyone can sell when they're selling out  
And anyone can fly when they're falling now  
  
I had a dream that we were more  
A generation to behold  
Lighting fires with our words  
Instead of useless smoke that blurs

To try to be sure and open the door

You come and go  
And no one is supposed to know  
But ever since you caught my stare  
You know I know that you are real  
  
Well Santa I've been thinking  
And I'm just in need one thing  
You to bring me, something shiny  
  
Like diamond ring  
Just a little something from Tiffany's  
Or a big ruby  
You know that has always looked good on me  
  
I won't tell (I wont't tell anyone)  
Anyone  
I've been good all year long  
Oh Santa make my Christmas Eve  
4 Carats please  
  
Oh oh  
Oh  
  
It's getting late  
I know you have your rounds to make  
But I've been waiting up for you  
And now the clock has just struck 2  
  
I'm looking out my windows  
Looking for a red nose  
My heart's sinking  
Don't forget me  
  
Oh my diamond ring  
Just a little something from Tiffany's  
Or a big ruby  
You know that has always looked good on me

Now I see a family where there once was none, now we've just begun,  
Yeah, we're gonna fly to the sun.  
  
And even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya honey,  
And everything will bring a chain of love.  
And in the morning when I rise, you bring a tear of joy to my eyes,  
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.  
  
Love the girl who holds the world in a paper cup, drink it up,  
Love her and she'll bring you luck.  
And if you find she helps your mind, buddy, take her home,  
Don't you live alone, try to earn what lovers own.  
  
And even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya honey,  
And everything will bring a chain of love.  
And in the morning when I rise, you bring a tear of joy to my eyes,  
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.

[Black Rob]  
Hey , back on the scene  
Ain't nuthin' changed  
Still doin' wild things  
Whippin' something mean  
The whole shorts in the Rolls Royce is off  
For sure, bouncin' the bar on my next world tour  
When we hit the sick, I'm the cure  
We 'bout to pop it off so wild, hit the floor  
Ain't nobody botherin' you  
All I'm thinkin' 'bout is clobberin' you  
Immigration always sayin' I'm harboring a few  
Illegal aliens  
Females, mostly Latins and Israeli-ans  
The top story, evening news  
I'm the shit, they been deceiving you  
Drop the roof on the Coupe D'Ville  
Shoot to kill  
Ask niggas, Duke is real  
Stay lookin' for the loot to steal  
He determined  
Don't try to touch Bad Boy, cause we burnin'  
I want my glory  
Duke is not a joke, and I ain't gotta story  
Every time I grab the mic it's with the sole intent  
To rip shots and give you 2OO percent  
Man, I'm tired of doin' dirt  
Tired of being on the the run from Wyatt Earp  
Rather be somewhere in a quiet church, sayin' prayers  
Not only sayin' mine, but sayin' theirs  
That's cause my dogs ain't there  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
The more hits we make, more money to burn  
The more fame we get, niggas get concerned  
It don't matter who's hot, who's out  
Bad Boy is Back For Good Now

I hit the bar, yo, it's all on me  
Pop bottles, models, be all on me  
You all goin' see how it's all gon' be  
Front on me and see where you all gon' be

One time like this  
  
Now would you clap your hands  
Your hands you clap  
If your girl's outta place then your girl get tapped  
Niggas keep thinkin' Diddy ain't on it like that  
But you never see me standing on the corner like that  
Cause, I'm talented, yes I'm gifted  
Never boosted, never shoplifted  
Forget get the cash, the money ain't nothin'  
Cause everything I talk about, you know I ain't fronting  
I rock Sean John everyday  
Boutiques from France to the USA  
And I make all the chips off the hits I invent  
So it really doesn't matter how much I spent

You burn me?

Give you one option, temperature's droppin'  
Gettin' cold, control your soul when I'm locked in  
You the type of chick that fold when you boxed in  
Signals my watch and givin' you more reasons to hop in  
This is a Bentley, not a Datsun  
Don't confuse me with dude, I'm not him  
Your man got a lot to learn  
But you could leave with the cat if you that concerned  
One day you goin' actually learn  
But not now cause, girl, I got tracks to burn

My skin the sun began to fry like bacon

And hadn't they just seen me up on Haleakala  
I kept on body surfing to pretend I hadn't heard  
There was someone there beside me, swimming like Richard III  
And I'm still smiling  
Seven naked native girls swam seven sacred pools  
Lone-ranger smoking doobies said you're breaking all the rules  
Better get your clothes on or else there'll be a row  
If it wasn't for my sunstroke I would take you on right now  
And I'm still smiling

She entered right in through my heart

She moves among the fruit and grain  
You can meet her after heavy rain has fallen

I'll hold out my hand  
And my heart will be in it  
  
For all we know  
This might only be a dream  
We come and we go  
Like the ripples, like the ripples in the stream  
So baby, love me, love me tonight  
Tomorrow was made for some  
Oh, but tomorrow  
But tomorrow may never, never come  
For all we know  
Yes, tomorrow may never, never come  
For all we know

Ozzy Osbourne,Iron Man,/o/ozzy+osbourne/iron+man_20308337.html,"Has he lost his mind?  
Can he see or is he blind?  
Can he walk at all,  
Or if he moves will he fall?  
Is he alive or dead?  
Has he thoughts within his head?  
We'll just pass him there  
Why should we even care?  
  
He was turned to steel  
In the great magnetic field  
Where he traveled time  
For the future of mankind  
  
Nobody wants him  
He just stares at the world  
Planning his vengeance  
That he will soon unfold  
  
Now the time is here  
For Iron Man to spread fear  
Vengeance from the grave  
Kills the people he once saved  
  
Nobody wants him  
They just turn their heads  
Nobody helps him  
Now he has his revenge  
  
Heavy boots of lead  
Fills his victims full of dread  
Running as fast as they can  
Iron Man lives again!

What kind of a way to try to take a look  
  
Until I got hurt I was looking, I was on my way  
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, darling I painted my face grey

Cause 'till you make that final show  
You'll never know what love you've been missing  
Missing  
  
You say you want to seek the truth but you work alone  
No one to help you and nobody to push you on  
So you sit at home drinking your wine, television on  
You wait for a miracle, 'cause you say one day one'll come along

Alabama,Patches,/a/alabama/patches_20522142.html,"(Spoken)  
I was born and raised down in Alabama  
On a farm way back up in the woods  
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches  
Papa used to tease me about it  
Of course deep down inside he was hurt  
'Cause he done all he could  
  
(Sang)  
Papa was a great old man  
I can see him with a shovel in his hand  
See, education he never had  
He did wonders when the time got bad  
The little money from the crops he raised  
Barely paid the bills he made  
So life had kicked him down to the ground  
When he tried to get up  
Life would kick him back down  
One day papa called me to his dyin bed  
Put his hands on my shoulders  
Then with a tears he said  
Patches, I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you  
  
(Spoken)  
Two days later papa passed away  
And I became a man that day  
So I told mama I was gonna quit school  
She said that was daddy's strictest rule  
  
(Sang)  
So every morning 'fore I went to school  
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too  
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on  
I wanted to leave just run away from home  
But I always remembered what my daddy said  
With tears in his eyes on his dyin bed  
He said, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you  
  
(Spoken)  
Then one day a strong rain came  
And washed all the crops away  
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying  
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders  
But you know, mama she knew what I was going through,  
  
(Sang)  
Everyday I had to work the fields  
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals  
You see, I was the oldest of a family  
And everybody else depended on me  
Every night I heard my mama pray  
Lord, give him the strength to make another day  
Though years have passed and all the kids are grown  
And amgels took my mama to a brand new home  
Lord knows people that I she'd a tear  
My daddy's voice kept a-tinging in my ears  
Sayin, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you...  
  
Patches, I'm depending on you son  
I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you...

Five days in a row  
My words all run together  
My feet are moving slow  
I've got to stop and eat  
While it's still light  
There's a local angel sitting on my right  
Do you believe in love at first sight  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
  
I'm ordinarily very shy  
And I'd be polite if I had time  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
Tomorrow, I'll be good and gone  
Please don't make me wait that long  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
  
I get off at eleven, she said  
And walked away  
She poured a cup of coffee and  
She brought it on a tray  
She said, ""it would be nice if you could stay  
You're the best idea I've had all day.""  
Usually I put up a fight but  
Baby, you look good to me tonight.  
  
Well I'm ordinarily very shy  
But I grinned at her as I ate my pie  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
I thought I must be in a dream  
When she asked me if I wanted cream  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
  
All in all you know  
It's not a bad life on the road  
If you've got wheels to roll  
And lucky stars above  
Your destiny's your own  
You go as far as you can go  
And if there's time to sleep  
There's time to make love  
  
I came, I saw, I conquered  
But I rode off in the sun  
But I know the look she left with me  
Keeps telling me she won  
Her face is the only thing I see  
Whispering those words of prophesy  
  
I may come easy, but I don't come free  
You're never gonna see the last of me  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
I was born to love you now can't you see  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
I'm ordinarily very shy  
But I take the time to satisfy  
Baby, you look good to me tonight

Others calling to the frying pan

By the Thrifty Mart sign

There's a young girl  
With sweet little dreams and pretty blue wishes  
Standin' there just gettin' all wet  
  
Now there's a place off the drag  
Called the Gilbert Hotel  
And there's a couple letters  
Burned out in the sign  
  
And it's better than a bus stop

For little girls with nothing in their jeans

The old man is snoring  
Now I lay me down to sleep  
I hear the sirens in the street  
All my dreams are made of chrome  
I have no way to get back home  
I'd rather die before I wake  
Like Marilyn Monroe  
And you could throw my dreams out in the street  
And let the rain make 'em grow  
  
Now the night clerk he got a club foot  
He's heard every hard luck story  
At least a hundred times or more  
  
He says: check out time is 10 am  
And that's just what it means  
Go on up the stairs  
With sweet little wishes and pretty blue dreams  
  
And it's raining it's pouring  
And Hollywood's just fine  
Swindle a little girl out of her dreams  
Another letter in the sign  
  
Now never trust a scarecrow wearin' shades after dark  
Be careful of that old bow tie he wears  
It takes a sweet little bullet from a pretty blue gun  
To put those scarlet ribbons in your hair  
  
No that ain't no cherry bomb  
Fourth of July's all done  
Just some fool playin' that second line

Arrogant Worms,Having Fun Is Bad For You,/a/arrogant+worms/having+fun+is+bad+for+you_20009362.html,"I used to go to all the parties  
And make love to all the beautiful ladies  
And I'd eat cheeseburgers with bacon and extra grease when I was  
Hungry  
And drink Windex Colladas until my skin turned blue  
But now,the times they are a-changing  
My lifestyle, it is rearranging  
For debauchery may be fun and entertaining  
But it is also very bad for you  
Do you know how many diseases you can get  
Making love to someone who has not had all their tests  
So nowadays, I am celibate  
And I wear a condom, in case I have dirty thoughts  
I never drive my car past the speed limit  
And I always wear my seat belt when I am in it  
I traded my Lambourghini for a Honda Civic  
Because it is more fuel-efficient and practical  
Ay-yi-yi! Ay-yi-yo!  
Being boring is the way to go!  
Ay-yi-yi! Ay-yi-yo!  
Having fun is bad for you!  
I can no longer smoke my cigarettes  
Because I found that they are a major cause of death  
The tar and nicotine have not killed me yet  
But if I got pregnant, they could hurt my baby  
I used to love my sorry complexion (sorry?)  
I tanned myself to perfection  
But the sun can give you a cancerous infection  
So now I'm white and pasty and I never leave the house  
I used to eat like there was no tomorrow  
But then I found cholesterol is full of sorrow  
The last thing I want to do is to have to borrow  
Somebody else's heart, because mine is full of fatty deposits  
Ay-yi-yi! Ay-yi-yo!  
Being boring is the way to go!  
Ay-yi-yi! Ay-yi-yo!  
Having fun is bad for you!  
Having fun is bad for you!

Tracy Chapman,I Did It All,/t/tracy+chapman/i+did+it+all_20767318.html,"A Cosmopolitan, a Manhattan  
Call me one  
Pour a round for me and my friends  
Cape Cod Sea Breeze, Long Island Ice Teas  
I won't go there or drink it if you paid me  
  
When they come to waylay me  
When they close in for the capture  
I did it all  
I did it all  
For the love and the laughter  
I did it all  
I did it all  
I did it all  
  
Slept in late  
Stayed up for days  
Partied hard  
Lived my twenties in haze  
Smoked second-hand in crowded bars  
With the A-list of B-list movie stars  
  
When they come to arrest me  
Pat me down and undress me  
I'll confess without miranda  
Strike a pose for the tabloid cameras  
I did it all  
I did it all  
I did it all  
  
I did it all  
I didn't ask permission  
I did it all  
What kind of life  
Is not an exhibition  
I did it all  
Crash and burn  
And then you know you're living  
I did it all  
Some pain a few tears after  
I did it all  
To the last line of the final chapter  
I did it all  
I did it all  
  
My heat is a wound that festers  
Seduced my share in silk and polyester  
Oh my great loves  
And my few losses  
I'll tell it all  
When my little black book is published  
  
When they come to interview me  
For my made for TV movie  
Say I'm the bitch who was a bastard  
Who did it all for the love and laughter  
I did it all  
I did it all  
I did it all

Venom,Firelight,/v/venom/firelight_20199131.html,"You light a match  
And watch it start a fire  
You take a drug  
That makes you fall much higher  
You plant a seed  
And grow a field of fury  
You make a law  
Where you're the judge and jury  
  
It's firelight  
  
You suffocate  
Denying all his glory  
You meditate  
It's not your fuckin' story  
You flick a switch  
To set the scene in darkness  
You break a law  
Where you collect the profits  
  
It's firelight  
  
You sit it out  
Refusing condemnation  
You take a shot  
Pretending it's a play thing  
You plant a bomb  
Forget to set the timer  
You wake up dead  
The firelight reminds you  
  
The fire's out!

Kirk Franklin,Outro,/k/kirk+franklin/outro_20325300.html,"I refuse to be another black statistic  
A black man who can wine and dine in the sin of the world and still be
considered a christian  
I plan on being great  
I care not to be less  
I refuse to wear a bar code across my chest  
I refuse to let a black tee or throwback jersey define me  
I refuse to let my children witness divorce  
Or make mature decisions in court  
I refuse to grow up carrying the generational curse  
I refuse to feel the need to curse in my verse  
I hate being automatically looked at when someone asks can anyone rap  
I wanna be a black man that can flip it from urban to corporate measures  
A black man who doesn't gain knowledge from the world for his own pleasures  
A black man who reps Christ to the fullest with no regrets  
My only regret is the stigma that many black statistics in the past have set  
Like going to jail, bragging about bail, leaving our kids, cussing at church,  
Married and you still flirt, no father present at birth  
Animosity within the ministers of our church  
I refuse to let my people be viewed as temporary  
I plan on planting a seed not for the moment but for one that's legendary  
As for statistics  
My father broke the mode  
And I feel its my job for the next generation to continue in it  
Because I refuse to be another black statistic

Green Day,Jackass,/g/green+day/jack+ass_20062783.html,"To know you is to hate you  
So loving you must be like suicide

I guess I just can't listen  
To this one sided conversation again  
'Cause I don't care if you don't care  
No one ever said that life is fair  
  
Everybody loves a joke  
But no one likes a fool  
And you're always cracking the same old lines again  
You're well rehearsed on every verse  
And that was stated clear  
But no one understands your verity  
  
The center of attention  
Got an honorable mention once again  
Congratulations and salutations  
You're a figment of your own imagination  
  
Everybody loves a joke  
But no one likes a fool  
And you're always cracking the same old lines again  
You're well rehearsed on every verse  
And that was stated clear  
But no one understands your verity  
  
To know you is to bait you  
And you fell victim to your own denial  
I don't mind if you don't mind  
If you're wasting all your time

Rainbows in the woodland, water to my knees  
Shivering, quivering, the warm breath of spring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
  
Catbirds and cornfields, daydreams together  
Riding on the roadside the dust gets in your eyes  
Reveling, disheveling, the summer nights can bring

Slanted rays and colored days, stark blue horizons  
Naked limbs and wheat bins, hazy afternoons  
Voicing, rejoicing, the wine cups do bring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
  
Harsh nights and candlelights, woodfires a-blazin'  
Soft lips and fingertips resting in my soul  
Treasuring, remembering, the promise of spring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses

Hey! realin' and a rocking, what a crazy sound,

I rose out of me seat Lord, I had to dance,  
Started moving my feet, well a clapping my hands.

The front doors was locked Lord, the place was packed,  
When the police knocked, those doors they flew back.

I'm gonna pull myself up outta this state  
I'm gonna make everything seem alright, alright

One of these days I'm gonna wreck myself and this engine won't run no more, no

I don't know why  
Pretending to be oh so strong  
Oh why  
Is there something I don't know  
Or something very wrong, with you and me  
Or maybe  
  
That's the way it is, there's nothing I can do,  
That's just the way it is.  
  
They've been waiting for word to come down  
They've been waiting for you night and day  
They won't wait any longer for you  
It may already be too late  
  
And I don't know why.  
  
You see the dying, you feel the pain  
What have you got to say  
If we agree that we can disagree  
We could stop all of this today  
  
It's been your life for as long as you can remember  
But you cannot fight no more  
You must want to look your son in the eyes  
When he asks you what you did it for  
  
'Cos all day long he was fighting for you  
And he didn't even know your name  
Young men come and young men go  
But life goes on just the same  
  
I don't know why...

Squeeze,Gone To The Dogs,/s/squeeze/gone+to+the+dogs_20129249.html,"Down at the dogs the bets are placed  
A wad of notes rolled in a hand  
The floodlit track is center stage  
For winning hounds to take the stand  
In old covert coats and trilby hats  
The owners swan around the place  
The tic tac man throws out his arms  
His thin moustache stretched on his face  
  
Gone to the dogs the man and his life  
He stands by the rail and looks at the sky  
Confused by the thoughts  
That stew in his mind  
Alone by the track on a Saturday night  
  
Gone to the dogs  
He stands and reflects  
Gone to the dogs  
And has no regrets  
  
The restaurant's full and table bets  
Are taken by the girls who serve  
The basket meals and German wine  
Excitement mounts  
The buzz is heard  
The stadium is full of screams  
And cigar smoke is in the air  
The dogs race around on their last lap  
And down the straight they chase the hare

And forgotten scenes

Escape from this deam

No matter where you are  
I hate being alone  
  
Love is sweet  
And bitter too  
The taste can leave cold

But I cannot refuse to capture control  
  
How it seems  
There's no way out  
I guess I never knew  
Emptiness has left no doubt  
Now I want you

Spilled dreams soaking into thirsty dust

Strength to push the seas apart

Backhand your ex-man, tell him kill the drama?

Make you want to be my next hottie, uh-huh  
From the bottom to the bottom to the top to the top  
Cruise it don't stop

Take my advice, go shinning up a tree

I ain't lyin', I've got the bluest kinda blues  
Drivin' me right outta my mind

Kissed her good-bye and my-my, my money too  
I've got hard luck, the hardest kinda luck you've seen  
I mean, the way I'm runnin' lately  
My lucky number is thirteen  
  
Where do I belong, everything I do is wrong, all wrong  
Wrong as can be  
Who's stacking all the decks, lady luck has got the hex on me  
I'm on her knee  
  
Shove off, oh I'm warning you  
This thing I caught, you know could be catchin' too  
I've got hard luck, the hardest kinda luck there can be  
Yes siree, I guess hard luck always chooses  
Natural born losers like me

Giving birth to a child of Earth and verse  
  
Together we slay another fright

We were here, roaming on the endless prairie  
Writing an endless story  
Building a Walden of our own  
We were here, grieving the saddened faces  
Conquering the darkest places

And become the music, one with alpenglow

You are my path, my home, my star  
A beautiful tale within the tale  
And when the dust needs to move on  
I will tuck us in on a bed of snow  
Painting white, silencing the valley we built  
Together we'll sleep, devoured by life

Paul McCartney,Don't Be Careless Love,/p/paul+mccartney/dont+be+careless+love_20105633.html,"Burn the midnight lamp  
Down until the dawn,  
I'll keep watch until I'm sure your coming home.  
Shadows play and flicker on the bedroom wall  
They turn into a bad dream overnight,  
Something could be terribly wrong.  
  
Don't be careless love,  
Don't be careless love,  
Don't be, don't be careless.  
  
In my dream you're running nowhere  
Every step you've taken turns to glue,  
Walking down a spiral staircase  
Failing through, failing through,  
  
Don't be careless love,  
Be careless love.  
  
The lamp burns down and out  
I'm getting pretty tired of this,  
I feel so bad something might be going amiss,  
  
I won't be there so look out for yourself  
You're getting in deep whatever you do,  
Don't let me go back to sleep,  
  
Don't be careless love,  
Don't be careless love,  
Don't be, don't be careless.  
  
Saw your face in the morning paper,  
Saw your body rolled up in a rug  
Chopped up into two little pieces  
By some thug,  
  
Don't be careless love,  
Be careless love.  
But in the morning light  
When I wake up again  
You're by my side and that's the way it's always been,  
But in the dark your mind plays funny tricks on you,  
Your mind plays funny tricks on you,  
Your mind plays funny tricks on you,  
  
Don't be careless love

Alphaville,Ain't It Strange,/a/alphaville/aint+it+strange_20006850.html,"Ain't it strange that we destroy  
What we embrace  
And we leave  
What we seek

Ain't it strange that we smile  
When we cry  
And no one knows why we are here  
And where we going to  
Ain't it strange  
We could be, we could be so good together  
Ain't it strange that we share what we hate  
That we break what we love  
It's such a shame  
Ain't it strange when we pray, we betray anyway  
And no one knows what we are for  
Why we're so tough  
When we're so fragile  
Ain't it strange  
  
Ain't it strange, still we could fall into a dream, I'd wish no one  
Will catch that fall  
For we could fall for love, life is but a dream, life is but a dream  
All the tears in the world not in vain for the pain is gone, the  
Shame is washed away  
When we're all one, life is but a dream, life is but a dream  
It's hard to believe after thousands of years  
The world is still drowning in blood and tears  
We've been quite advanced but again we fail  
It is dog eats dog on the ratrace trail  
It is getting too much and we're getting nowhere  
While hatred and fear is all that we share  
I can't take it no more when I'm watching the news  
We must stick together or we're bound to lose

I tied a rope around her waist  
I know when she's in and when  
She goes out  
Well there ain't nothing to guess about  
She covers her ears when i play my guitar  
She runs away but not very far  
Just push a button - retractable cord  
I pull her back when i get bored  
One word from her and she'd be free  
But she's exactly where she wants to be  
Magnetic Madonna she glows in the night  
Reciprocal pull, i flow to her light  
Woman i am bound to you  
But what do i want to do?  
Woman what do i want?

Just thinking about you  
Gives me such a thrill  
Let alone to be with you or know that I will  
And know that I'll tremble  
When I should be still  
Um, um, I, I do really love you  
Give me what I live for

And transform this yearning into ecstasy  
And send me, oh, send me - most humbly

Served with a letter sent to whom it may concern,  
Still around Lord, I'm still in town,

It's a cryin' shame, you don't even know my name,  
A low down lonesome song,

Wanda Jackson,Hot Dog! That Made Him Mad,/w/wanda+jackson/hot+dog+that+made+him+mad_20220319.html,"I got a guy, I like him fine  
But he takes me for granted all of the time  
To teach him a lesson, make him mad  
I went out on a date with the best friend he had  
That made him mad, boy, hot dog, that made him mad  
And he hugged me and he kissed me and he asked me not to do it again  
  
Oh, late, last night, when I came in  
He demanded to know just where I'd been  
But I really put him right in his place  
Instead of an answer, I laughed in his face  
That made him mad, boy, hot dog, that made him mad  
And he hugged me and he kissed me and he asked me not to do it again  
  
He said my heart is on my sleeve  
And if I didn't change that he would leave  
Well, you should've seen him, was his face red  
When I laughed and told him just go right ahead  
That made him mad, boy, hot dog, that made him mad  
So he hugged me and he kissed me and he asked me not to do it again  
  
Well, the moral is to play it cool  
Let your guy know you're nobody's fool  
When he gets to thinking you're all his own  
Let him know that you can take him or leave him alone  
That makes him mad, boy, hot dog, that makes him mad  
And he'll hug you and he'll kiss you and ask you not to do it again  
  
Yeah, he'll hug you and he'll kiss you and he'll squeeze you and please you  
And ask you not to do it again

Venom,Acid,/v/venom/acid_20165057.html,"My brain fed with ecstacy  
Fills my need  
As I feel my body burst with great speed  
And I clench a needle in a blood drained fist  
Then I turn and mark another trip off my list  
A)Feel that rush,with that gold  
Satanic dust  
Feel that pain,the drug induce through  
My veins  
I will in life as I will in death  
Sow the seeds with every breath  
Never will I run,never will I hide  
Only to express myself and feel it deep  
Inside  
Acid  
Now I dream in comatose neuotic state  
As my paranoia grows I must wait  
Til the feeling of the drug starts to die  
Then I'll hit the drug again,take me high  
B) Feel that buzz,for all the goddam  
Good it does  
Feel the flight,that flies me in through  
Day and night  
Now inside my arteries there's no blood

Down by the Mississippi in Louisiana.

Yes, Anna.  
  
Anna I  
  
She's the one with the looks, I'm realistic,  
She's just a little mad, my head is on straight.  
But we're really one divided being  
Even though you see two of us  
And both of us are Anna,  
Together we've but a single past, a single future,  
One heart and one savings account,  
And we only do what's best for one another.

By the dawn's early light,  
What so proudly we hailed,  
At the twilight's last gleaming?  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars,  
Through the perilous fight,  
O'er the ramparts we watched,  
Were so gallantly streaming.  
And the rocket's red glare,  
The bombs bursting in air,  
Gave proof through the night,  
That our flag was still there.  
Oh say does that star spangled banner yet wave,  
For the land of the free, and the home of the brave.

Moving through the shadows, almost going blind  
Living like a legend before my time

If I can make it home alright, you know, I'll treat you fine

With your man out on the road  
So I'll be coming home tomorrow  
To try to help you carry the load  
I'm running out of highways and bridges to burn  
This kind of living is taking its toll on what I've learned  
You know, it ain't easy leaving you behind  
Living like a legend before my time  
But someday, baby, I'll be coming home to stay  
Wrapped up in your warm love every night and every day  
Ooh, I'm going out of my mind  
Living like a legend before my time  
I know, it wasn't easy for you, baby  
With your man out on the road  
So I'll be coming home tomorrow  
To try to help you carry the load  
I'll be getting up early 'cause I know, I'm coming home  
I'm so tired of living this legend life alone  
Kick off your shoes, babe, we'll drink a little wine

Greeting smile after smile

Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
Strings of street lights, even stop lights  
Blink a bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures  
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids hunch

Many years ago along the Illinois-Wisconsin Border  
There was this Indian tribe  
They found two babies in the woods  
White babies  
One of them was named Elizabeth  
She was the fairer of the two  
While the smaller and more fragile one was named Marie  
Having never seen white girls before  
And living on the two lakes known as the Twin Lakes  
They named the larger and more beautiful Lake, Lake Elizabeth  
And thus the smaller lake that was hidden from the highway  
Became known forever as Lake Marie  
  
Repeat Chorus:  
  
Many years later I found myself talking to this girl  
Who was standing there with her back turned to Lake Marie  
The wind was blowing especially through her hair  
There was four italian sausages cooking on the outdoor grill  
And Man, they was ssssssssizzlin'  
Many years later we found ourselves in Canada  
Trying to save our marriage and perhaps catch a few fish  
Whatever seemed easier  
That night she fell asleep in my arms  
Humming the tune to ""Louie Louie'  
Aah baby, We gotta go now.  
  
Repeat Chorus:  
  
The dogs were barking as the cars were parking  
The loan sharks were sharking the narcs were narcing  
Practically everyone was there  
In the parking lot by the forest preserve  
The police had found two bodies  
Nay, naked bodies  
Their faces had been horribly disfigured by some sharp object  
Saw it on the news On the TV news in a black and white video  
You know what blood looks like in a black and white video?  
Shadows, Shadows that's exactly what it looks like  
All the love we shared between her and me was slammed  
Slammed up against the banks of Old Lake Marie, Marie

Keep me wide awake

Thieving bastards stole my life and legged it off into the night.

Been there since time began.

Everything gets out of hand.  
They've got the lot and god knows what they think that the deserve even more.  
Psychopathic tendencies, they've got a lot of answer for.  
Scratch my back and I'll stab Yours, no wonder it's a universal sickness.  
Who are they, you well might ask, come with me and you can be my whitness.  
It's a dirty business it's a crying shame.

Bob Dylan,Changing Of The Guards,/b/bob+dylan/changing+of+the+guards_20021554.html,"Sixteen years,  
Sixteen banners united over the field  
Where the good shepherd grieves.  
Desperate men, desperate women divided,  
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves.  
  
Fortune calls.  
I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace,  
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down.  
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born,  
On midsummer's eve, near the tower.  
  
The cold-blooded moon.  
The captain waits above the celebration  
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid  
Whose ebony face is beyond communication.  
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.  
  
They shaved her head.  
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo.  
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale.  
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow,  
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.  
  
I stumbled to my feet.  
I rode past destruction in the ditches  
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo.  
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches  
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.  
  
The palace of mirrors  
Where dog soldiers are reflected,  
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,  
The empty rooms where her memory is protected,  
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.  
  
She wakes him up  
Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking  
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks.  
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking.  
He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.  
  
Gentlemen, he said,  
I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes,  
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards  
But Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination  
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.  
  
Peace will come  
With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire  
But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall  
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating  
Between the King and the Queen of Swords.

So I said  
Fellas, like to ask you a thing if I may  
  
What about Livingstone?  
What about all those men?  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
Traveling up the Nile  
Putting themselves on test  
Didn't that help the rest?  
Wasn't it worth it then?  
What about Livingstone?  
  
And all of those fellas at the local news-stand  
Didn't know what to answer or what to say  
So I told them about him, that he was just like  
One of those spacemen in his way

Then there's only a thing I can say

Funny how it only took  
Goodbye to make it real

Would tear my world apart  
Who could've known I'd be alone  
With just my broken heart

Neil Young,Change Your Mind,/n/neil+young/change+your+mind_20099173.html,"When you get weak,  
And you need to test your will  
When life's complete,  
But there's something  
Missing still  
Distracting you from this

Can change your mind

And there's an odor in the room  
The scent of love,  
More than a million roses bloom  
Embracing you with this

Must be the one  
Whose magic touch  
Can change your mind

Incubus,Azwethinkweiz,/i/incubus/azwethinkweiz_20067143.html,"Floatin' round my brain,  
Tryin' to think about the other thing.  
Than that thought you know I'm considering.  
What if what I thought,  
About who I think I though I was,  
Was nothing more than my cerebellum slobbering?  
Azwethinkweizm is hard to think about,  
But simple to trust.  
  
You'll know your on it  
When your brain won't stop to take a break, no!  
So when donut boy comes askin' around,  
Tryin' to figure out somethin' new,  
You just smile and say,  
""Pardon you! I'm sifting through  
Some particles and farcing through some folds.  
I've stumbled upon a brain fart  
Which melts away your molds!""  
  
So I think upon that ponder  
While I'm pondering the thought,  
Just thinkin' about the thinkweiz  
Is leaving me distraught!  
Well I think I thought  
I saw an Azwethinkweiz,  
Lookin' like we think we do.  
Like we think we do.  
  
Some think I'm insane,  
'Cause I think about the other thing,  
Than that one thought you call reality.  
What if what you thought,  
About who you think you thought you were,  
Was nothing more than illusion rapidly crumbling!  
Azwethinkweism should be a topic we all can trust.  
  
It's just to bad it makes your  
Head go zippity crack dang!  
So when donut boy comes sniffing around  
Trying to figure out something new,  
You just laugh and say, ""Pardon you,  
I'm sifting through some particles and  
Farcing through some folds.

Looky-loo lookin' like you think you do.

And so you disappear  
In chaos waters I do swim

A frail creature now gets dim  
(As the gold turns into blue)  
Made me think you were so damn near

Conway Twitty,Ballad Of Forty Dollars,/c/conway+twitty/ballad+of+forty+dollars_20512033.html,"The man who preached the funeral said it really was a simple way to die  
He laid down to rest one afternoon and never opened up his eyes  
They hired me and Fred and Joe to dig the grave and carry up some chairs  
It took us seven hours and I guess we must have drunk a case of beer  
  
I guess I oughta go and watch 'em put him down but I don't own the suit  
And anyway when they start talkin' bout the fire and hell well I get spooked  
So I'll just sit here in my truck and act like I don't know him when they pass  
And anyway when they're all through I've got to go to work and mow the grass  
  
Well here they come and who's that ridin' in that big ole shiny limousine  
Hm look at all that chrome I do believe that that's the sharpest thing I've
seen  
That must belong to his great uncle someone said he owned a big ole farm  
When they get parked I'll mosey down and look it over that won't do no harm  
  
Well that must be the widow in the car and would you take a look at that  
That sure is a pretty dress you know some women do look good in black  
He's not even in the ground and they say his track is up for sale  
They say she took it pretty hard but you can't tell too much behind a veil  
  
Now listen ain't that pretty when the bugler plays the military taps  
I think that when you's in the war they always hired and played a song like
that  
Well here I am and there they go and I guess you'd call it my bad luck  
I hope he'll rest in peace but trouble is that fellow owed me forty bucks

I'd be safe from harm.  
I would never find myself  
Lost inside your arms.  
If i didn't love you  
I'd never feel the pain  
Of sunny days without you  
Drowning in the rain.  
If i didn't love you  
  
If i didn't love you  
Peace would rule the day  
All the dark and out would surely go away.  
If i didn't love you  
I wouldn't pay the cost  
Of living every endless day  
If our love is lost.  
If i didn't love you  
If i didn't love you  
  
And yet you make me breathless  
At the way you move  
I never knew that i  
Could ever love the way we do.  
I don't know how you reach me  
In that place in my heart  
Belonging to only you.  
  
If i didn't love you  
I wouldn't lose control  
The danger loving brings a word  
Never touch my soul.  
If i didn't love you  
Perhaps i wouldn't die.  
If you should ever say to me  
""i'm sorry, goodbye.""  
If i didn't love you  
How can there be music  
In the way you touch?  
I can't believe that somehow  
I believe in you so much.  
Now you've come and taught me  
How to give you my heart.  
And make me feel at last  
That the end will never start.  
You're the only reason  
I'm not afraid to fall.  
For if i didn't love you  
If i didn't love you  
I wouldn't love at all.

Because I find myself with  
  
No strings and no connections  
No ties to my affections  
I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy  
  
No dates that can't be broken  
No words that can't be spoken  
Especially when I am feeling romancy  
  
Like a robin upon a tree  
Like a sailor that goes to sea  
Like an unwritten melody  
I'm free, that's me  
  
So  
  
Bring on the big attraction  
My decks are cleared for action  
I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy

Just like the autumn leaves have fall for you.  
All for you.  
  
You changed my life, you changed my ways.  
I don't even recognize myself these days.  
It must be a reflection of you.  
Only you.  
  
I can't remember feeling love like this in so long.  
I can't imagine living life without you by my side.  
Day after day you find a way to make this grown man cry.  
It's so true, I'm all for you.  
  
My arms still hold you tight, keep you warm in the coldest night.  
My hand to pull your hair right back away from your eyes.  
For you. Only you.  
  
If I knew how to do it,  
I'd paint the moon, the stars around you.  
Paint the perfect kind of sunset.  
But I couldn't make it more beautiful than you.  
Oh, nothing compares to you.  
You know it's true.

Through the poverty and grime  
Of the empty streets below

Will I be a working man?  
And occupy my idle mind

The killers must be fed, the soil is red

At least a thousand time  
If she loved me she'd stop me but no  
  
Oooh I know I'm not perfect  
But at the end of the day  
Who is? Oooh  
She wanted someone that's perfect  
Okay  
But can you tell me who is?  
  
I saw something worth my future  
So wrong, so wrong  
In my mind I was all it took  
But I guess I wasn't wrong  
  
Oooh I know I'm not perfect  
But at the end of the day  
Who is?  
She wanted someone that's perfect  
Okay  
But can you tell me who is?  
  
Oooh Ooh Oooh  
Oooh Ooh Oooh

Dolly Parton,Behind Closed Doors,/d/dolly+parton/behind+closed+doors_20041768.html,"My baby makes me proud  
Lord, don't he make me proud  
He never makes a scene  
Hangin' all over me in a crowd  
'Cause people like to talk  
Lord, don't they love to talk  
But when they turn out the lights  
I know he'll be leavin' with me  
  
And when we get behind closed doors  
Then we let out hair hang down  
Then he makes me glad that he's my man  
And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors  
  
My baby makes me smile  
Lord, don't he make me smile  
I'm never far away  
Or too tired to say I want to  
I'm purring like a kitten  
When he's out in public with me  
But when they turn out the lights  
He brings out the tiger in me  
  
And when we get behind closed doors  
Then we let out hair hang down  
Then he makes me glad that he's my man  
And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors  
  
Behind closed doors

Where it was gonna be at back then  
Why don't we turn the whole bloody lot down  
And make a new start all over again?  
  
I can recall Utopian thinking  
Bold mission statements and tightening of belts  
Demolition of familiar landmarks  
Promises made and deals that were dealt  
  
This used to be the future  
Where it was at back then  
Let's turn the whole bloody lot down  
And start all over again  
  
But that future was exciting  
Science fiction made fact  
Now all we have to look forward to  
Is a sort of suicide pact  
  
Was it the dear old future  
That created the problems we face?  
How do we deal with the fallout  
Of the age we used to call space?  
  
I can remember planning for leisure  
Living in peace and freedom from fear  
Science that promised to make us a new world  
Religion and prejudice disappear  
  
I can remember when this was the future  
Where it was gonna be at back then  
Now religion and nuclear energy have united  
To threaten, oh God! Amen  
  
This used to be the future

Rush,The Weapon,/r/rush/the+weapon_20346223.html,"We've got nothing to fear...but fear itself?  
Not pain, not failure, not fatal tragedy?  
Not the faulty units in this mad machinery?  
Not the broken contacts in emotional chemistry?  
With an iron fist in a velvet glove  
We are sheltered under the gun  
In the glory game on the power train  
Thy kingdom's will be done  
And the things that we fear are a weapon to be held against us  
He's not afraid of your judgment  
He knows of horrors worse than your Hell  
He's a little bit afraid of dying  
But he's a lot more afraid of your lying  
And the things that he fears are a weapon to be held against him  
Can any part of life be larger than life?  
Even love must be limited by time  
And those who push us down that they might climb  
Is any killer worth more than his crime?  
Like a steely blade in a silken sheath  
We don't see what they're made of  
They shout about love, but when push comes to shove  
They live for the things they're afraid of  
And the knowledge that they fear is a weapon to be used against them

Steely Dan,A Little With Sugar,/s/steely+dan/a+little+with+sugar_20246913.html,"I remember Christmas morning  
Back in 1954  
When we moved up to Mount Savage  
As if it mattered anymore  
Mama always said  
How the air can clear her head  
  
We were colder and much higher  
Than we ever were before  
I recall her tailored jersey  
And the flowers that she wore  
Years ago I tried to tell her  
What was in my heart  
But she was part of the city  
  
[Chorus]  
She took a little with sugar  
She took the money from my old man  
She took a little with sugar  
She took the money from my old man  
  
All the years that she was with us  
You could count them on one hand  
I was taken with her showboat style  
But too young to understand  
She was all alone  
Ahead of her time  
She was first generation

They'll leave their darkness as you shine the light he shed,

And his joy will be manifest in you,  
And the lost will be found as he works through you.  
Out on the highways, theres so many passing by,  
Step out in boldness and watch the family multiply,  
Pray up some miracles, lets open up the sky,  
And his joy will be manifest to you,  
And the lost will be found by the things you do.  
Oh dont you know that jesus loves you,  
So lets go and spread his word,  
Redeem the time while theres still time,  
Lets share the call we heard, lets share the call we heard.  
Is your house open to let strangers enter there,  
Give to the least of them, show them someone cares,  
And you may be entertaining angels unaware,  
And his joy may be manifest to you,  
And the lost may be found as he works through you,  
And his joy will be manifest in you,  
And the lost, theyll be found by the things you do.

Of ""what might have beens""

Waterboys,The Return Of Jimi Hendrix,/w/waterboys/the+return+of+jimi+hendrix_20145278.html,"I dreamed about Jimi Hendrix  
He came back for one day  
Was born weepin' out of an egg  
The mid-wife said  
And straight away began to pray  
With lifted head  
  
He spent the early hours  
Communing with the morning stars  
And then he came over to my house  
Where he tried out my guitar  
  
He was young and black and beautiful  
Big eyed, perfect skin an'  
He played my guitar like a lightning storm  
Like twirlin' feathers in the wind  
He could make it sound like the end of the world  
A fire, the flick of a knife  
He could squeeze it slow and masterful  
Like the hand that brought the world to life  
  
Together we strolled in sculptured gardens  
Passed the sleepy afternoon  
Maids were dartin' back and forth  
From a window came a violin tune  
Angels, dressed as nurses toyed with playin' cards  
Looters sprung from prisons filled the yard  
  
A yellow sun hung low and dawned,  
And as it dipped  
Jimi stood up straight, grinned  
And shook his velvet hips  
  
Callin' himself King Electric  
In the evening he went wild  
Played on a dozen stages  
In the clubs of New York -  
Lit the city end to end  
Wired it up, fired it up  
Scarved, bejewelled, long-legged, snake-limbed  
Athletic, driven, dangerous  
  
He made all Manhattan shake  
And every street and sidewalk quake  
His stratocaster caused the mighty Empire State  
To vibrate  
His whammy bar caused shock-eyed punks from  
Hackensack and Yonkers  
Raised on speed, metal and rap  
To enter trance and levitate  
  
He played Purple Haze and Pyramid,  
Voodoo Child and Sin-E,  
Up From the Skies and Storm Free  
In King Tut's Wah-Wah hut  
  
He did a forty-two minute  
Cosmic rise I

Fuck bitches, get money, fuck niggas, get money  
  
You want to sip Mo' on my living room flo'  
Play Nintendo with Cease-a-Leo  
Pick up my phone say, ""Poppa not home""  
Sex all night, mad head in the morn'  
Spin my V, smoke all my weed  
Tattoo on titty sayin' B-I-G, now check it  
You want to be my main squeeze, baby  
Don't cha, you want to gimme what I need, baby  
Won't cha, picture life as my wife, just think  
Full length mink, fat X and O links  
Bracelets to match, conversation was all that  
Showed you the safe combinations and all that  
Guess you could say you's the one I trusted  
Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?  
Shit got hot, you sent Feds to my spot  
Took me to court, tried to take all I got  
'Nother intricate plot, the bitch said I raped her  
""Damn, why she want to stick me for my paper?""  
My Mo-sci-no ho, my Ver-sa-ce hottie  
Come to find out, you was fuckin' everybody  
You knew about me, the fake ID  
Cases in Virginia, body in D.C.  
Woe, oh is me, that's what I get for trickin'  
Pay my own bail, commence to ass kickin'  
Kick in the door, wavin' the four-four  
All you heard was, ""Poppa, don't hit me no more""  
Disrespect my clique, my shit's imperial  
Fuck around and made her milk box material  
You feel me? Suckin' dick, runnin' your lips  
'Cause of you, I'm on some real fuck a bitch shit, uh

Fuck niggas, get money  
Fuck bitches, get money  
Fuck niggas, get money  
  
niggas betta grab a seat  
Grab on your dick as this bitch gets deep  
Deeper than the pussy of a bitch six feet  
Stiff dicks feel sweet in this little petite  
Young bitch from the street, guaranteed to stay down  
Used to bring work outta town on Greyhound  
Now I'm Billboard now, niggas press to hit it  
Play me like a chicken, thinkin' I'm pressed to get it  
Rather do the killin' than the stick up jooks  
Rather count a million while you eat my pussy  
Push me to the limit, get my feelings in it  
Get me open while I'm cummin' down your throat  
Then, you want to be my main squeeze, nigga  
Don't cha, you want to lick between my knees, nigga  
Don't cha want to see me whippin' your three down the Ave.  
Blow up spots on bitches because I'm mad  
Break up affairs, lick shots in the air  
You get vexed, and start swingin' everywhere  
Me shifty? Now you want to pistol whip me  
Pull out your nine while I cock on mine  
Yeah, what, nigga? I ain't got time for this  
So what, nigga? I'm not tryin' to hear that shit  
Now you want to buy me diamonds and Armani suits  
Adia Vinadini and Chanel lime boots  
Things that make up for all the games and the lies  
Hallmark cards sayin', ""I apologize""  
Is you wit' me? How could you ever deceive me  
But payback's a bitch, motherfucker, believe me  
Naw, I ain't gay, this ain't no lesbo flow  
Just a lil' somethin' to let you motherfuckers know  
  
Fuck bitches, get money, fuck niggas, get money

Two or three flying saucers  
Parked under the stars, winding stream  
Moon shining down on some little town  
And with each beam the same old dream

Pulled down my sun visor  
Boy, I really felt blue  
  
You jumped into your Gemini, I jumped into mine  
We'll orbit the Moon for just one time  
Tomorrow night, tomorrow night  
Will you hold hands with me under the moonlight?

I shot my space gun  
And I thought about you

Tim, Jaimme and Gab.  
Keeping him up while his mistress rings his hands.  
Picked him up after school  
Just make sure you're looking good.  
And no one's leaving.

Propping up the bar at the Raffle's hotel.  
And no one' leaving.

Electric Light Orchestra,All Fall Down,/e/electric+light+orchestra/all+fall+down_20045483.html,"What can you tell me, of the perfect man.  
What can you tell me, now I don't quite understand.  
We lose our grip, we glide and stall.  
Some things come easy, some don't come at all.  
We chip away at the perfect man.  
What can you show me, now I don't quite understand.  
Eye to eye nothing left to say  
But will you really throw it all away.  
We trip, we stumble, and we all fall down.  
Things go wrong, though are strong.  
We slip, we fumble, and we all fall down  
Round and round, we all fall down.  
Sometime....  
No matter how we try to keep things straight.  
It makes no difference, while we cause our fate.  
We burn our candle unaware.  
While on our knees we cry in prayer.  
We trip, we stumble, and we all fall down.  
Pain won't last, this too shall pass.  
We slip, we fumble, and we all fall down  
Round and round, time and time, again.  
But ahhhh,  
If it's so simple then explain to me.  
How pain is so close to ecstasy.  
How change can make you feel so free.  
Ahhhh,  
If we were meant to be such perfect fools.  
Then why do we always break the rules,  
Crashing through life's scenery.  
We trip, we stumble, and we all fall down.  
Angry cries and desperate lies.  
We slip, we fumble, and we all fall down  
Hearts to mend, sun comes up again.

Counter productive  
How we gonna make it  
When we do not know where love lives [2x]  
  
I'm not seeing what you're saying  
All the games that you are playing  
Look like tactics for delaying  
While we're on our knees and praying  
Making and breaking  
Sitting and debating  
The art of speculating  
Then accumulating  
  
I'm not buying what you're selling  
All your shouting and a yelling  
And the lies that you are telling  
Don't strike me as compelling  
Picking and choosing  
Winning and losing  
Cutting and bruising  
Using and abusing  
  
I'm not taking what you're giving  
The elections you are rigging  
From your penthouse living  
The deals that you are fixing  
Creeping and crawling  
Running and falling  
Stopping and stalling  
Crying and bawling

Always too shy to carry the whole thing through  
  
Like the light from that eternal flame  
Burns for one without a name

Gordon Lightfoot,Early Mornin' Rain,/g/gordon+lightfoot/early+mornin+rain_20061596.html,"In the early mornin' rain  
With a dollar in my hand  
And an aching in my heart  
And my pockets full of sand  
I'm a long ways from home  
And I missed my loved one so  
In the early mornin' rain  
With no place to go  
  
Out on runway number nine  
Big seven o seven set to go  
Well I'm out here on the grass  
Where the pavement never grows  
Where the liquor tasted good  
And the women all were fast  
There she goes my friend  
She's rolling out at last  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar  
See the silver wing on high  
She's away and westward bound  
For above the clouds she flies  
Where the mornin' rain don't fall  
And the sun always shines  
She'll be flying over my home  
In about three hours time  
  
This ol' airport's got me down  
It's no earthly good to me  
Cause I'm stuck here on the ground  
Cold and drunk as I might be  
Can't jump a jet plane  
Like you can a freight train  
So I best be on my way  
In the early mornin' rain  
So I best be on my way  
In the early mornin' rain  
So I best be on my way  
In the early mornin' rain

They now had more important things to say  
And when the car broke down they started walking

Joni Mitchell,Not To Blame,/j/joni+mitchell/not+to+blame_20075444.html,"The story hit the news  
From coast to coast  
They said you beat the girl  
You loved the most  
Your charitable acts  
Seemed out of place  
With the beauty  
With your fist marks on her face  
Your buddies all stood by  
They bet their fortunes  
And their fame  
That she was out of line  
And you were not to blame  
  
Six hundred thousand doctors  
Are putting on rubber gloves  
And they're poking  
At the miseries made of love  
They say they're learning  
How to spot  
The battered wives  
Among all the women  
They see bleeding through their lives  
I bleed,  
For your perversity,  
These red words that make a stain  
On your white-washed claim that  
She was out of line  
And you were not to blame  
  
I heard your baby say  
When he was only three  
""Daddy, let's get some girls  
One for you and one for me.""  
His mother had the frailty  
You despise  
And the looks  
You love to drive to suicide  
Not one wet eye around  
Her lonely little grave  
Said, ""He was out of line girl  
You were not to blame.""

She had to turn around  
  
When she couldn't hold oh, she folded,  
A dissident is here  
Escape is never the safest path  
Oh a dissident a dissident is here  
  
And to this day she's glided on  
Always home but so far away  
Like a word misplaced  
Nothing said, what a waste  
When she had contact, with the conflict,  
There was meaning, but she sold him to the state  
She had to turn around  
  
When she couldn't hold, she folded,  
A dissident is here  
Escape is never, the safest path  
Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here  
  
She gave him away when she couldn't hold, no, she folded,  
A dissident is here  
Escape is never, the safest path  
Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here  
Couldn't hold on, she couldn't hold, no, she folded,  
A dissident is here  
Escape is never the safest place  
A dissident is here

Xzibit,Everything,/x/xzibit/everything_21046454.html,"[Chorus]  
I was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen  
I remember underage drinking at sixteen  
Then my nuts in Cali banging at seventeen  
Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything  
  
My back was to the wall, visited all, after all, all I had was me  
Just tenacity, so we all leave with a sense of sweet  
Then everything I write around got a cotton seat  
Fuck y'all dry, saw off and done rapidly  
Partner, now let's be honest, ain't got no good intentions  
The upper tune is the dudes moving in my position  
But I'm a heavy, wait humble, hitting the heavy bag  
Waiting for the day I stumble across your fucking ass  
Instead I push the work in, chin up and chest out  
Picking the shit up where I left off  
You went soft intention too tenant to deal with the Los Angel  
I admit it, I bull shit and gave you the wrong angle  
Now I have a seat at my table, let me do you the business  
Diversify you millions, you can leave off the entrance  
Make every revenue street flood to where it took me  
And make that money stack higher than giraffes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I used to have a Glock that I would shot to at backpack  
So it will leave no shells at the scene  
Where I was getting my kid back  
Yeah, this for the homie whack, rolled to and chopped up  
On hard to make the west defined a united fund  
Beard big, light it up, waiting on that vending truck  
So I can crush the corner, welcome to California  
Where people fake it 'till they make it  
Or take it with their hand gun  
Take your chances, swing, try to land one  
Now you're in the box like a sand some, I march to the madness  
My symphony deliver something classic  
Either you ain't glad or you blast it, jumped in or dragged it  
Either way, you got to salute the flag, who you want it with?  
I acknowledge honest with whole heart and integrity  
People keep telling me I'm about to catch a felony  
Stage presence, reminiscent of my flash back  
Gave my girl a son and my last name  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Motherfucker, I live in room that look like a drive-in  
When I open my eyes a bunch of bitches play violins  
Nothing but respect when I walk to the lights in  
Because I kill everything, bitch, I kill everything  
Nothing ever compares with the spring of a free mind  
Find the most dangerous weapon ever acquired by mankind  
Using to fight for your freedom and oppress your oppressors  
You mold them and lead them, fuck the positive message  
This is a lifetime allegiance, boy, you're down to the essence  
There's no payment for passage, my immaculate presence  
Make every revenue street flood, look where it took me  
And make that money stack high and you run a pussy

Why should I even try to breathe

Cause you'd thought that ya'll was  
Inseparable  
Thou we stay together  
Always and forever

One of us just got to pick the phone up  
Cause I know we're still  
Inseparable  
  
Got photos of us on my refrigerator  
Videos on my phone, why can't I just erase them  
The first text I ever got from you still saved in my inbox  
And I read it like time after time  
  
Boy I'm lost, can't you look, won't you please find me  
I'm down to my last tick, come rescue me  
See it's broken my heart, to the point where I don't need, to have a reason

Weak now cause I just ain't the same with out you

The seeds that are sown  
They still control me

There's a thief upon my bed

Lead me to some peaceful land  
That I cannot find  
Inside my head  
  
Wake me with love  
It's all I need  
But in all this time  
Still no one said  
  
If I had not asked  
Would you have told me  
If you call this love  
Why don't you hold me

There's a thief upon my bed  
And the strangest thing

Give me something to believe in

Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion  
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high  
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man  
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man  
I hear the voices when I'm dreamin',  
I can hear them say  
  
Carry on wayward son,  
For there'll be peace when you are done  
Lay your weary head to rest  
Now don't you cry no more  
  
Masquerading as a man with a reason  
My charade is the event of the season  
And if I claim to be a wise man, it surely  
Means that I don't know  
On a stormy sea of moving emotion  
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean  
I set a course for winds of fortune, but  
I hear the voices say  
  
Carry on, you will always remember  
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor  
Now your life's no longer empty  
Surely heaven waits for you

Rush,The Pass,/r/rush/the+pass_20120029.html,"Proud swagger out of the schoolyard  
Waiting for the world's applause  
Rebel without a conscience  
Martyr without a cause  
  
Static on your frequency  
Electrical storm in your veins  
Raging at unreachable glory  
Straining at invisible chains

Staring down into a heartless sea

Turn around and turn around and turn around  
Turn around and walk the razor's edge  
Don't turn your back  
And slam the door on me  
  
It's not as if this barricade  
Blocks the only road  
It's not as if you're all alone  
In wanting to explode  
  
Someone set a bad example  
Made surrender seem all right  
The act of a noble warrior  
Who lost the will to fight  
  
And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge  
Staring down into a heartless sea  
Done with life on a razor's edge  
Nothings what you thought it would be  
  
No hero in your tragedy  
No daring in your escape  
No salutes for your surrender  
Nothing noble in your fate

Their old familiar carols play,  
And wild and sweet the words repeat  
Of peace on earth, good will to men.  
  
I thought how, as the day had come,  
The belfries of all Christendom  
Had rolled along the unbroken song  
Of peace on earth, good will to men.  
  
And in despair I bowed my head:  
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said,  
""For hate is strong and mocks the song  
Of peace on earth, good will to men. ""  
  
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:  
""God is not dead, nor doth he sleep  
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail  
In peace on earth, good will to men.

Madonna,More,/m/madonna/more_20086878.html,"Once upon a time I had plenty of nothing,  
Which was fine with me.  
Because I had rhythm, music, love,  
The sun, the stars and the moon above,  
Had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea.  
That was when the best things in life were free.  
  
Then time went by and now I got plenty of plenty,  
Which is fine with me.  
'Cause I still got love, I still got rhythm,  
But look at what I got to go with 'em.  
""Who could ask for anything more?"", I hear you query.  
Who would ask for anything more? Well, let me tell you, dearie.  
  
Got my diamonds, got my yacht, got a guy I adore.  
I'm so happy with what I got, I want more!  
  
Count your blessings, one, two, three  
I just hate keeping score.  
Any number is fine with me  
As long as it's more  
As long as it's more!  
  
I'm no mathematician, all I know is addition  
I find counting a bore.  
Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting.  
[More! More!]  
  
I got rhythm, music too, just as much as before  
Got my guy and my sky of blue,  
Now, however, I own the view.  
More is better than nothing, true  
But nothing's better than more, more, more  
Nothing's better than more.  
  
One is fun, why not two?  
And if you like two, you might as well have four,  
And if you like four, why not a few  
Why not a slew  
[More! More!]  
  
If you've got a little, why not a lot?  
Add and bit and it'll get to be an oodle.  
Every jot and tittle adds to the pot  
Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle.  
[More! More!]  
  
Never say when, never stop at plenty,  
If it's gonna rain, let it pour.  
Happy with ten, happier with twenty  
If you like a penny, wouldn't you like many much more?  
  
Or does that sound too greedy?  
That's not greed, no, indeedy  
That's just stocking the store  
Gotta fill your cupboard, remember Mother Hubbard.  
[More! More!]  
  
Each possession you possess  
Helps your spirits to soar.  
That's what's soothing about excess  
Never settle for something less.  
Something's better than nothing, yes!  
But nothing's better than more, more more  
[Except all, all, all]  
Except all, all, all  
Except once you have it all [have it all]  
You may find all else above [find all else above]  
That though things are bliss,  
There's one thing you miss, and that's  
More! More!  
More! More! More! More!  
More! More! More!

Everybody in the party  
If you came here to party  
Better move your body  
Damn look at that body  
Everybody in here  
Put your hands in the air  
Wave 'em like you don't care  
Let me hear you say 'yeah'  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
This place is jumpin'  
We keep it bumpin'  
The boys keep watchin'  
Wanna leave with something  
We makin' it clap  
Clap, clap, clap, clap  
We don't need hands for that  
That, that, that, that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 2]  
Get wild and crazy  
If you wanna get crazy  
So free, so young  
So you can't blame me, yup  
Let's get this clear  
All the boys over there  
Keep lookin' over here  
But we don't care  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Pull your camera out  
Cause someone's gonna wanna see this  
Take a picture, snap it  
Aye, post it for the world  
Cause when we goin' out  
We run the town  
Better believe it  
We gon' be sexy, sexy  
Me and my girls, girls, girls  
This is how we roll

Donna Summer,Virgin Mary (german Edition Track),/d/donna+summer/virgin+mary+german+edition+track_20553434.html,"Look at the lady with the crazy stare in her eyes  
Looks way past 50 though she's barely 35  
Sleeps most days in the city park  
Every night down at Casey's bar  
And if she talks at all you hear her say  
""I was a lovely girl in my younger days""  
She was the prettiest girl this town had ever seen  
But she dressed too gaudy for the likes of the people here  
Out every night living life to the full  
A string of men at her beck and call  
But smalltown people got smalltown ways  
And soon she was stuck with a brandnew name  
Hey Virgin Mary  
Lover of lovers  
How many others  
Your bed is never empty  
It must bring you plenty  
Oh that fateful night there was thunder in the air  
The women were angry and the men felt like a share  
A lynch mob frenzy came over the town  
Grabbed hold of Mary, threw her down to the ground  
The first man there that had Mary laid  
Staggered back with shock on his face  
Hey Virgin Mary  
Be true to your name  
We've put you to shame  
You're not what we thought  
The victim of talk!  
Hey Virgin Mary  
Rumour was your ruin  
Evil talk was your undoing  
Heavy on the conscience  
Jealous talk and nonsense  
You were really like your name  
And we put you to shame  
You're not really what we thought  
Jealous talk and nonsense

Dusty Springfield,I'm Coming Home Again,/d/dusty+springfield/im+coming+home+again_20043982.html,"I'm not as crazy as I used to be  
Some of my devils upped and left me free  
To find a quiet space  
I'm not as out of place  
  
I'm not as lonely as I was before  
I don't go in 'less there's an open door to leave by  
I'm starting to believe my own existence has a right to be  
  
And I'm comin' home again  
It's been too long a time  
Gettin' back what's mine  
And I can't remember why I went away  
But it's lookin' now like maybe I can stay  
  
The poets cried for dreams they never saw  
The only certainty is nothin's sure  
And most things stay the same  
Or go back where they came  
  
And though my answers still are undefined  
By takin' chances I can start to find some reasons  
Somethin' to believe in  
I can make it through  
I can make it through  
  
And I'm comin' home again  
It's been too long a time  
Gettin' back what's mine  
And I can't remember why I went away  
But it's lookin' now like maybe I can stay  
  
Oh, and I'm comin' home again  
It's been too long a time  
Gettin' back what's mine  
And I can't remember why I went away

Damn damn j.b, where the hell you been  
Yeah I got a new necklace, diamonds  
2 big face rollies, no I ain't lyin'  
Making momma so proud that she cryin'  
Yeah you say I'm crazy? guess that makes two  
But I never knew that dreams really came true  
Started playing drums, when I was only 2  
Now we kick it in japan, kung-fu  
So I'm heading for the gold, I'm sweating  
I swear otis redding will be oh-so ready  
I already got ahead-y of the game, I'm with kenny  
And we steady getting many, I mean money  
Riding in an all-black benz with the all black rims  
And we looking at some 10s through our all-black lenses  
  
[Justin bieber]  
Wait... I'm not done  
  
[Verse 2: justin bieber]  
I thanked jesus at the awards I'm never going to hell  
Call me zack morris I'm saving you by the bell  
My girl says I'm perfect she just loves them perfect persons  
Perfectly personally I think she is perfectly perfect  
I get it done abundantly, she wants to get up under me  
I swear I got honey bee's cause baby I'm a money tree  
So be my little honey be my little-bitty bunny  
I got honeys all up on me baby I just get it done-y  
Possibly you're probably thinking this type of swag is impossible  
And logically will probably but you just take me lyrically  
Try to feel me spiritually, get out your mind literally  
There's a bigger me inside this little me  
Screaming out, I should make history  
I am like a mystery, hated by jealousy cause they envy me  
Run up on my enemies see if they remember me  
Soon as they remember me I wipe away their memory  
Can't you see the private jets flying over you?  
I ain't even notice but my focus on my photos  
Might be bogus, no they shouldn't be a photoshoot  
It's funny how you wanna take my picture and it's like your first time  
Playing with camera claiming that ""it's not mine""  
Just calm down, you don't gotta hurry  
Don't be nervous, you don't gotta worry  
And my fans are like my glasses, yeah without them I'd be blurry

Luther Vandross,I Can Tell You That,/l/luther+vandross/i+can+tell+you+that_20489467.html,"One day I'll always remember  
Was when you walked into my life  
It was a very special night  
When we danced so close, so tender  
It gave my heart the second chance  
That I'd been waiting for  
  
But our love is falling  
All kinds of pressure has temptation calling  
It gives me fever  
But no matter what, I ain't gonna leave you  
I'm gonna stay till the last day  
Worry no more, what is love for?  
I hear love knocking honey  
Come on, let's open the door  
  
You know you've got me to love  
I can tell you that  
If you should ever need some love  
You just call me back  
I've been loving you from the start  
Let me tell you that  
And I'll keep loving you from my heart  
Sure can tell you that  
You've got so much to love  
  
Every time that we kiss  
I'm reminded it's you I miss  
I just love when we love like this  
I can tell you that  
Please forgive me if I pout  
But my world would turn inside out  
If on leaving me you insist  
Let me tell you that  
  
I start to hold you but you pull back,  
not much just a little  
I can't control you  
When you get so caught up in the middle  
First you say yes, then you say no  
Said you're gonna stay, now you're gonna go  
You know I'll tell you honey  
But I think you already know  
  
I can tell you this  
Anytime you go I really miss you  
Nothing to do, tired of my friends  
Won't you come back and love me again?  
So I can tell you that  
You've got me forever girl to love

Styx,Crystal Ball,/s/styx/crystal+ball_20132963.html,"I used to like to walk the straight and narrow line  
I used to think that everything was fine  
Sometimes I'd like to sit and gaze for days through sleepless dreams  
All alone and trapped in time  
All alone and trapped in time  
  
I wonder what tomorrow has in mind for me  
Or am I even in it's mind at all  
Perhaps I'll get a chance to look ahead and see  
Soon as I find myself a crystal ball  
Soon as I find myself a crystal ball  
  
Tell me, tell me where I'm going  
I don't know where I've been  
Tell me, tell me, won't you tell me  
And then tell me again  
My heart is breaking, my body's aching  
And I don't know where to go  
Tell me, tell me, won't you tell me  
I've just got to know  
  
Crystal ball  
There's so many things I need to know  
Crystal ball  
There's so many things I've got to know  
Crystal ball  
  
If you should see me walking  
Through your dreams at night  
Would you please direct me  
Where I ought to be  
I've been looking for a crystal ball  
To shed the light  
To find a future in me  
To find a future in me

There's so many things I need to know

UB40,Sing Our Own Song,/u/ub40/sing+our+own+song_20141817.html,"The great flood of tears that we've cried  
For our brothers and sisters who've died  
Over four hundred years  
Has washed away our fears  
And strengthened our pride  
Now we turn back the tide  
  
We will no longer hear your command  
We will seize the control from your hand  
We will fan the flame  
Of our anger and pain  
And you'll feel the shame  
For what you do in gods name  
  
[Chorus]  
We will fight for the right to be free  
We will build our own society  
And we will sing, we will sing  
We will sing our own song  
  
When the ancient drum rhythms ring  
The voice of our forefathers sings  
Forward Africa run  
Our day of freedom has come  
For me and for you

That's the word out on the town  
It gives a certain fascination  
But it can only bring you down  
  
You better turn yourself around  
Turn yourself around  
Turn it upside down  
Turn yourself around  
  
You had bad breaks well that's tough luck  
You play too hard too much rough stuff  
You're too sly so cold  
That bad reputation has made you old

Turn it upside down

Jimi Hendrix,May I Whisper In Your Ear,/j/jimi+hendrix/may+i+whisper+in+your+ear_20071711.html,"May I whisper in your ear  
From my heart so you'll clearly hear...  
There are people so dear...  
They're like children...  
Naked in a cold world...  
Beautiful children  
In an old world...  
  
May I take you away  
From the evils of today  
To the dreams of tomorrow.  
You know that heaven...  
Has no sorrow.  
You know that heaven...  
Has no tomorrow.  
  
Hear the sound of the magic drums...  
Hearts are beating for the sun...  
Sending evil on the run...  
Now watch the wind...  
  
Look over yonder...  
Here comes some news...  
Coming down like lightning...  
Straight for me and you.  
People of destruction  
Your time is out of date...  
People who's living crooked,  
Better start getting straight.  
  
I've been through some changes,  
A whole lot of re-arranges...  
Been through some ups and downs,  
And whole lot of turn arounds.  
I been on the shelf and even killed myself...  
1, 000 times ago and maybe 1, 000  
Times more.  
  
She said she comes from ice land...  
I told her I was from the west.  
She took me to the snow capped mountains...  
And then she put me through the test...  
We walked across the glacier,  
The horses stayed behind...  
And as we laid between the  
Frozen vallies we kissed  
For the very first time.  
And now we're stuck together.  
  
It was too long ago.  
But it seems like... Years ago...  
Since I felt the warm hello of the sun.  
Lately things seem a little colder...  
The wind, it seems to get a little bolder.  
  
Forget of my name  
Remember it only as a hand shake,  
Introduction to my belief which is god.  
Ride instead the waves of my interpreture,  
Music, sound  
Hynotic if you choose  
But truth and life  
Regardless of your questionable timid compromises  
Which I intend to erase.  
Which I will erase without hint of reward  
As I am only a messenger  
And you a sheep in process of evolution  
Almost at death with yourself  
And on the staircase of birth.  
Soon you may almost forget the smell of your family...

Nazareth,Back To School,/n/nazareth/back+to+school_20098597.html,"You didn't listen when you went to school

You think you'll hit the target every time that you fire  
You think you know the difference between love and desire  
But someone's waiting to turn you around  
She'll shoot you down and put your feet on the ground  
It's not like dreamin' you can make mistakes  
A lesson learned is not so easy to take  
Now you're going back to school

You're doin' numbers but you don't keep the score  
They're scratchin' the surface but they don't  
Reach the core  
You only bought the ticket 'cause the price was ""all in""  
You'll never reach the heart until you've broken the skin  
You're busy running but you never relax  
Live now pay later including the tax  
But now your education is about to begin  
Forget about the stories and the places you've been  
Now you're going back to school  
Now you're going to learn the rules  
Now you're going back, you're going back  
You're going back to school  
Back to school back to school

Because I'm all alone now nobody is with me  
Nobody to threaten that they about come get me  
I wish I could go back to where we began  
I wish you was alive so I could kill you again  
I wish we had more paths to cross  
Nobody even cares if they survive my loss  
My killer's remorse  
  
For me we are the same should be laughed at  
Could be the very fame shit to get your bitch ass clacked  
You fell slick next now drowning in your own pool out back  
I kick the cats and dog tube the shit I don't count that  
You're my angel of death I strangle till there's no breath  
I kill the kill kill till there ain't nobody left  
My conscience don't inhibit me I kill deliberately  
Just wanna be like God, cause God kills indiscriminately  
I'm so christian I'm so muslim  
Super size on your mom trigger get push up  
I'm parallel to hell I'm ready so Satan what's cooking  
And rappers running their mouth they don't know how close their bitch ass is
coked

I said memories fade just as blood washes off  
Hope to see you soon

From decorating your face all over the building  
I'm staying sincere if I ain't making it clear  
I'm writing on the wall with the blood man I wished you were here  
But you moved on at your funeral I beat you with slam  
I hugged your mom tell your sister and her kids to be clam  
I will tell 'em you gone you just sleep in a dream and all c'est la vie  
We smoked you like the weed in the bong  
  
Have you ever seen the bloodstain  
And know that person has returned from every once came  
Regret is such an ugly thing only if you let it fuck with your brain  
But it ain't gonna change a fucking thing  
What's done is done chop that shit up to the game  
You're still dead when I'm still alive  
And I never got the chance to utilize my best alibi

Started the bullshit escalated to violence  
In result of the violence infinite permanent silence  
Now I feel empty not even existing  
My worst enemy is no longer against me  
I remember the hatred and how it consumed me  
And you felt the same thing but never could move me  
A shot to the face is nothing like in the movies  
The back of your brain is out the body keeps moving  
So I should rejoice now because you are past tense  
The last of my enemies the last of you bastards  
The dirt on your casket  
I'm so alone now you were the reason to carry my danger my chrome out  
And I just sold out and wait for the contact  
And life for the combat and now we be on that  
And I'd take it all back if I knew what I knew now  
What's a shooter without somebody to shoot down

Thought I must look crazy something out of place  
But paid it no attention  
Just kept going with my business  
I looked up because she stepped into my space  
Saw pain in her eyes  
Her question took me by surprise she said  
I didn't have the faintest clue where to begin  
So I asked some questions (just to see what I was dealing with)  
She told me where she was and where it was she'd been  
What an awful tale life hadnt done her well  
She had thoughts of leaving  
Bridge:  
(Before you go) let me tell my story  
(Once like you, you know) all guts and no glory  
(But now I have joy) the reason why  
Whos in my life  
That is why you're asking me  
See the moral of the story is the whole worlds watching you  
So be careful what you say and be careful what you do  
Never know when it will be your time to show someone the way  
So be a guiding light and shine so they'll say

And we don't need a reason to love

And when you close your eyes, I'll still be here  
And if the world falls  
You will be the only reason to love  
I'll find my way  
  
One heart may lie, one kiss may die  
But we live, live and learn to fly  
Beyond the darkest sky  
Stronger than the night  
  
If you hold me now, all that I feel is yours  
'cause' you're the only reason to love  
What you are to me, is all that you need to be  
And when you touch the stars, I will be there  
And when the world falls away  
I will be your only reason to love  
  
I'll find my way  
One heart may lie, one kiss may die

A heart will break and I won't feel the same

And a heart will break tonight

We made only words  
It's no consolation that we're free like the birds  
'cause who needs to fly like they do  
There's only one reason I'm staying  
It's 'cause I love you...i do

Stood Running Bear, young Indian brave  
On the other side of the river  
Stood his lovely Indian maid  
Little White Dove was her name  
Such a lovely sight to see  
But their tribes fought with each other  
So their love could never be  
Running Bear loved little White Dove  
With a love as big as the sky  
Running Bear loved little White Dove  
With a love that couldn't die  
He couldn't swim the raging river  
'Cause the river, it was too wide  
He couldn't reach little White Dove  
Waiting there on the other side  
In the moonlight, he could see her  
Throwing kisses 'cross the wave  
Her little heart was beating faster  
Waiting there for her brave  
Running Bear loved little White Dove  
With a love as big as the sky  
Yes, Running Bear loved little White Dove  
With a love that couldn't die  
Running Bear dove in the water  
Little White Dove, she did the same  
As they swam out to each other  
Through the swirling stream they came  
Now their hands touched and their lips met  
The swirling river, it pulled them down  
Now they'll always be together  
In their happy hunting ground  
Running Bear loved little White Dove  
With a love as big as the sky  
Yes, Running Bear loved little White Dove  
With a love that couldn't die

Chorus:  
Hey, little brother, welcome back home  
It's good to see you again  
Hey, little brother, welcome back home  
To your family and your friends  
Chorus  
Now you do not know  
What your Father's been through  
At night He would call out your name  
Then for hours untold  
He would stare down the road  
Praying you'd come home again  
Chorus  
I must confess I was quite envious  
When I heard what Father planned to do  
But after I talked to Him  
I realized I had been  
Almost as far from home as you  
I was almost as far from home as you, so  
  
Chorus  
Oh, dear brother run into my arms  
And tell me you are home to stay  
For there is no other Father like ours  
And we're so glad you're here today  
Yes, we're so glad you're here today

And of all the hearts in all the world, why yours and mine

Somewhere out there there's lovers who want to be free  
Why couldn't love have died with them instead of here with you and me

Phish,Train Song,/p/phish/train+song_20108345.html,"All the way home we felt we had a chance  
To review the coulds before we were born  
And to invite a new game of can'ts  
  
Absorbed in the clouds a voice from afar said  
""With the right device you can make a pattern grow  
Or you can tune up your car""  
  
So we stayed on the train admiring the time  
As the lights of the city drew near  
We drank a little wine  
  
They were blurry and green outer space in between  
With a depth and a form unclear  
Then we saw it up ahead  
  
A flickering lantern lit up on the tracks  
In the rugs that had covered up the bridge  
From the banks of a river to the bed  
Of the valley upstream to the place we live  
  
The glass on the lantern cast back the sight  
Of a drive-in movie we drove by below  
We saw where we'd been in the pictures within  
Projecting all the places we would go  
So we follow the scene and flowed up your steps  
To a smooth wooden floor in a trance  
The train whistle melody woved through the trees  
And in through the door to signal the turns of a dance

From the coast  
East of Aldgate  
Silently like ghosts  
They had a scam,  
They had a scheme  
For drunks and bums counting beans

They're Dancers, and Blitzens, and angels on high  
  
Chilly bones laughin' after the night

As he blows with his eyes froze tight  
Slidell boy, big city nights  
Oh, he tips his hat for dinner  
An old stray beggin' for a bite  
  
Oh, Christmas Katie, babe, blow your horn  
Play something happy, leave the sad one's alone  
Crackin' a smile as small as wishes  
Make us some merry, make it last for a while  
  
Hey, puttin' out the dog, put the wheels on tight  
Oh, play another sweet song  
Never want to see Katie cry

Oh, Christmas Katie, baby blow that horn  
Play something happy, leave the sad ones alone

And the saints all stand and applaud you.

Say farewell to the passing of the years,  
Though all your sweet goodbyes will fall upon deaf ears.  
Kiss so softly the mouths of the ones you love,  
Beneath the September moon and the heavens above.  
And the world will turn without you,  
And history will soon forget about you,  
But the heavens they will reward you,  
And the saints will be there to escort you.  
So faraway,  
So faraway and yet so close.  
  
Do not grieve at the passing of mortality,  
For life's but a thing of terrible gravity.

And the angels in heaven adore you,

Did hover unearthly  
In banners of fire  
I kneit in the garden  
Awash with the dawning  
And a voice came so brightly  
I covered my eyes

This bright new morning  
So steeped seemed the evening  
In darkness and blood

There'll be no sorrow  
There'll be no road too narrow  
There'll be a new day  
And it's today  
For us

Studying the lights  
The dreaming of escape  
Will keep you up at night  
  
But someone had put the flares up  
Got me in the rays so guess I better stay  
""Uh uh, no come on!"" You say  
  
""It's a fools gold thunder  
It's just warring rain  
Don't let the fears just start  
'What if I won't see you again'  
  
Around here you never  
Want to sleep all night  
So start falling in love, start the riot  
And come on, rage with me  
  
We don't need words, we'll be birds  
Got to make our own key""  
  
Only got this moment, you and me  
Guilty of nothing but geography  
  
Come on raise it  
Come on and raise this noise  
For the million people, who got not one voice  
  
Come on it's not over!  
If you mean it say loud  
Come on all for love  
Out from the underground away with me  
  
We don't need words  
Close your eyes and see  
We'll be birds flying free  
Holding on in the mystery  
  
Fearless through this you said  
We'll go through this together  
So when you fly won't you - won't you take me too?  
In this world so cruel I think you're so cool

Will steal your love from me

''cause I always led a life of my own  
Never waited for the ring of the 'phone  
Never had anyone here  
When I got home  
But love's about to change my heart  
  
I'm waiting for the doorbell to chime  
When I always lived one day at a time  
I thought that I was getting on fine  
Never felt I was alone  
'til you change your mind  
Love's about to change my heart  
  
Could a day be so long  
When I always felt secure and so strong  
And all the time as I went along  
Never thought I would desire  
So much to belong  
Love's about to change my heart  
Love's about to change my heart, ooh  
  
Never ever thought the sky was so blue  
Never ever thought I'd feel so new  
Always thought I'd know what to do  
But I guess I wasn't counting on you  
  
What did I know  
I always felt so much on control  
I thought I'd make it all on my own  
Never thought I would forget  
All I have known  
Love's about to change my heart  
Love's about to change my heart  
Love's about to change, change, change

Are you hungry?  
Are you thirsty?

You've got to lay it all out on the line

But brother, if you're like me  
Looking down that road  
Be careful of that wild wind, son

Can you taste it?  
Can you hear it knocking at your door?

And I bet you dare.  
And if I am to seek this place you can see,

I gaze upon a lake of backyard,

""Don't go 'cross that river,  
Because you might not make it back,  
The beast gonna eat your heart.""  
She said, ""Don't go out there,  
Stay upon your track.

Bit of business that I'm doing today.

I've been moving cross the river today,

Take me home! Take me home.

Nothing can stop them,  
Around every river and canal their power is growing.  
Stamp them out!  
We must destroy them,  
They infiltrate each city with their thick dark warning odour.  
  
They are invincible,  
They seem immune to all our herbicidal battering.  
  
Long ago in the Russian hills,  
A Victorian explorer found the regal Hogweed by a marsh,  
He captured it and brought it home.  
Botanical creature stirs, seeking revenge.  
Royal beast did not forget.  
He came home to London,  
And made a present of the Hogweed to the Royal Gardens at Kew.  
  
Waste no time!  
They are approaching.  
Hurry now, we must protect ourselves and find some shelter  
Strike by night!  
They are defenceless.  
They all need the sun to photosensitize their venom.  
  
Still they're invincible,  
Still they're immune to all our herbicidal battering.  
  
Fashionable country gentlemen had some cultivated wild gardens,  
In which they innocently planted the Giant Hogweed throughout the land.  
Botanical creature stirs, seeking revenge.  
Royal beast did not forget.  
Soon they escaped, spreading their seed,  
Preparing for an onslaught, threatening the human race.  
  
Mighty Hogweed is avenged.  
Human bodies soon will know our anger.  
Kill them with your Hogweed hairs

Only wanna lose myself behind the mirror of your eyes

Only want to lose my senses, lose your sorrow calm this madness

Don't intend to be the sword that runs you through with adoration  
I don't want to be a whisper, my emotions wrapped in silence  
Don't intend to be the shout, reminding you that time is priceless  
Only want to be the wind that lifts you high above the ground  
Living only to unleash the sacred powers that we've found  
Only want to breathe your essence, be your comfort, fill with laughter  
Every moment that we live from this day on, forever after

So his parents called him Independence Day  
He married a girl named Justice who gave birth  
To a son called Nation  
Then she walked away  
Independence he would daydream and he'd pretend  
That someday him and Justice and Nation would get together again  
But Justice held up in a shotgun shack  
And she wouldn't let nobody in  
So a Nation cried  
  
Oh oh  
When a Nation cries  
His tears fall down like missiles from the skies  
Justice look into Independence's eyes  
Can you make everything alright  
Can you keep your Nation warm tonight  
  
Well Nation grew up and got himself a reputation  
Couldn't keep the boy at home no no  
He just kept running 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round  
Independence and Justice well they felt so ashamed  
When the Nation fell down they argued who was to blame  
Nation if you'll just come home we'll have this family again  
Oh Nation don't cry  
  
Oh oh  
When a Nation cries  
His tears fall down like missiles from the skies

The dragon draws the iron curtain round against the light  
And souls grow weary in his war of love  
and seek their solace strolling down the sweet civilian ways  
But meanwhile back at the world's dark end  
The nations see no future waiting for the serpent to strike

Where is the resistance, will no-one be strong  
When will we stand up tall and straight, rise up and storm the gate  
How can we fail to get excited  
The battle is ours, why don't we fight it  
Battalions of darkness rise above me  
But God put a fighter in me, put a fighter in me  
So we will sing songs of victory  
We will rise and set men free  
We will applaud your majesty  
We will proclaim your kingdom come  
We will announce the battle done  
We will lift up the righteous one  
Listen and you're going to hear the sweetest sound you ever heard

It's the voice of one who calls his bride to come and to be ready  
Gentle as a dove he comes with fire

Procol Harum,A Whiter Shade Of Pale,/p/procol+harum/a+whiter+shade+of+pale_20111595.html,"We skipped the light fandango  
Turned cartwheels cross the floor  
I was feeling kinda seasick  
But the crowd called out for more  
The room was humming harder  
As the ceiling flew away  
When we called out for another drink  
The waiter brought a tray  
  
[Chorus]  
And so it was that later  
As the miller told his tale  
That her face, at first just ghostly,  
Turned a whiter shade of pale  
  
She said, there is no reason  
And the truth is plain to see.  
But I wandered through my playing cards  
And would not let her be  
One of sixteen vestal virgins  
Who were leaving for the coast  
And although my eyes were open  
They might have just as well've been closed  
  
[Chorus]  
And so it was that later  
As the miller told his tale  
That her face, at first just ghostly,  
Turned a whiter shade of pale  
  
She said, I'm home on shore leave,  
Though in truth we were at sea  
So I took her by the looking glass  
And forced her to agree  
Saying, you must be the mermaid  
Who took Neptune for a ride.  
But she smiled at me so sadly  
That my anger straightway died  
  
[Chorus]  
And so it was that later  
As the miller told his tale  
That her face, at first just ghostly,  
Turned a whiter shade of pale  
  
If music be the food of love  
Then laughter is its queen  
And likewise if behind is in front  
Then dirt in truth is clean  
My mouth by then like cardboard  
Seemed to slip straight through my head  
So we crash-dived straightway quickly  
And attacked the ocean bed

As the miller told his tale  
That her face, at first just ghostly,  
Turned a whiter shade of pale

And every little tap on the shoulder for attention  
Fails to mention I still hate you  
  
But there's a light on in Chicago  
And I know I should be home  
All the colors of the street signs  
They remind me of the pickup truck  
Out in front of your neighbor's house  
  
You want apologies, girl you might hold your breath  
Until your breathing stops forever  
The only thing you'll get  
Is this curse on your lips  
I hope they taste of me forever  
  
But there's a light on in Chicago  
And I know I should be home  
All the colors of the street signs  
They remind me of the pickup truck  
Out in front of your neighbor's...  
  
With every breath I wish your body  
Will be broken again  
  
With every breath I wish your body  
Will be broken again  
  
(There's a light on)  
With every breath I wish your body  
Will be broken again  
  
(There's a light on)  
With every breath I wish your body  
Will be broken again

I know that sweetheart time is here  
My love that blossoms in the springtime  
Blooms in my heart through all the year  
  
I love the blossoms in the springtime  
Kissed by the sunshine and the rain  
I love to hold you, oh my darlin'  
When kisses bloom in sweetheart's lane  
  
Sometimes a spark of love may smoulder  
Never to flame all winter long  
Then like the blossoms in the springtime  
Burst with the first red robin's song  
  
I love the blossoms in the springtime  
Kissed by the sunshine and the rain  
I love to hold you, oh my darlin'  
When kisses bloom in sweetheart's lane

Opeth,Heir Apparant,/o/opeth/heir+apparant_20781954.html,"Long days  
Slow waste  
Sew lies  
Sow hate  
  
So many years to clean the slate  
Endless despair within it's wake  
His touch soiling what used to be clean  
His gaze burning on the edge of our dreams  
  
No more  
Cold pace  
Slow days [?]  
  
And again he rides in  
It's September and he covets the gullible  
Skeletal wish - hunter  
A thousand lies  
Cast from the throne of secrecy  
  
Hear him spewing forth a meaning to miserable lies  
See the twisted hand of doubt seal the affair  
The insect trust - believer  
Your body a vehicle to  
  
Pearls before swine they are nothing but blind  
Submit to nothing and swallow my spit of scorn  
Invisible king - dying  
Procession of woe, struck down by sorrow  
  
A burden so great  
Weighs heavy on old and withered beliefs  
The swift solution crumbles  
Beneath the mock notes of a masterpiece  
Death in his eyes - waiting  
Spiraling judgment, provoked in the rains  
  
This futile test drowned in the levee of deception  
  
In the year of his sovereign  
Rid us of your judgment  
Heir apparent

My heart broke down inside me

I keep my truth from you.  
No one enters  
this secret place,  
the barrier only I embrace.  
Time is fleeing now they say,  
Take time to look inside and face, the change.  
  
Dig down deep  
to find the man I thought I was.  
A dog on a treadmill panting,  
the master pulls the leash, laughing.  
Now I can't remember why  
I needed to run, needed to try so hard.  
  
One more time around  
is all I ask for now,  
a star to seek by, wind to  
take me home again.  
  
""Work hard in life boy,  
there's paradise in the end.""  
Year after year we struggle to gain  
the happiness our parents never claimed.  
They told us all we had to do  
was do what we're told, buy what was sold,  
""Invest in gold, and never get old.""  
  
One more time around  
is all I ask for now,  
a star to steer by, wind to

Dead silent screams, come alive.

Eternal screams that slowly die.

Dimentia born of sin,  
A symptom that begins,  
Vengeance so divine.  
  
Lost my grip of what's real.  
Unrestrained self-induced vertigo.  
Manic power chills my spine.  
I can't erase this instinct I embrace.  
  
Two faced moral abandon,  
Races my blood boils my skin.  
Unhinging the doorway to this asylum,  
Releasing unshackled poison dreams.  
Beginning the end of temptation.  
A vengeance so divine.  
The end of temptation,  
A vengeance so divine.

I's three-fourths drunk, she looked uptight.  
She took off her wheel, took off her bell,  
Took off her wig, said, ""How do I smell?""  
I hot-footed it, bare-naked  
Out the window!  
  
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,  
Walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk.

When a can a black paint it fell on my head.  
I went down to scrub and rub  
But I had to sit in back of the tub.  
Cost a quarter  
And I had to get out quick  
Someone wanted to come in and take a sauna  
  
Well, my telephone rang it would not stop,  
It's President Kennedy callin' me up.  
He said, ""My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?""  
I said, ""My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,  
Anita Ekberg,  
Sophia Loren.""  
Put 'em all in the same room with Ernest Borgnine!

Eyes were closed I was half asleep.  
I chased me a woman up the hill,  
Right in the middle of an air raid drill.  
It was Little Bo Peep!

I jumped a bean stalk  
I jumped a Ferris wheel)  
  
Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote,  
He's a-runnin' for office on the ballot note.  
He's out there preachin' in front of the steeple,

I'll flip the channel to number four.  
Out of the shower comes a grown-up man  
With a bottle of hair oil in his hand.  
(It's that greasy kid stuff.  
What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is  
What do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner,  
Charles de Gaulle  
And Robert Louis Stevenson?)  
  
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen  
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.  
She takes about fifteen baths a day,  
Wants me to grow a cigar on my face.  
(She's a little bit heavy!)  
  
Well, ask me why I'm drunk alla time,  
It levels my head and eases my mind.  
I just walk along and stroll and sing,  
I see better days and I do better things.  
I catch dinosaurs  
I make love to Elizabeth Taylor  
Catch hell from Richard Burton!)

Cher,Half Breed,/c/cher/half+breed_20029614.html,"My father married a pure Cherokee  
My mother's people were ashamed of me  
The Indians said I was white by law  
The white man always called me  
""Indian Squaw""

Half-breed, that's all I ever heard  
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word  
Half-breed, she's no good they warned  
Both sides were against me  
Since the day I was born  
  
We never settled, went from town to town  
When you're not welcome you don't hang around  
The other children always laughed at me  
""Give her a feather, she's a Cherokee""

Nineteen I left them, tell me who's to blame  
My life since then has been from man to man  
But I can't run away from what I am

In macro vision  
Our bodies moving  
With pure precision  
One universal celebration  
One evolution  
One creation  
  
Thundering rhythm  
Pounding within me  
Driving me onwards  
Forcing me to see  
Clear and enlightening  
Right there before me  
Brilliantly shining  
Intricate beauty  
  
See the microcosm  
In macro vision  
Our bodies moving  
With pure precision  
One universal celebration  
One evolution  
One creation

Everclear,Lame,/e/everclear/lame_20052079.html,"Then they came on me  
They dragged me from the bar  
Still wet from sweat and beer  
  
I bruise so prettily by men  
Blinded by their fear, these men  
Broke my back and made me lame  
  
Then she said to me  
""I'd give you everything to make it like before  
To make you love me like you used to""  
  
Make you love me more  
She said to me  
""Your life is large but your mind is lame""  
  
I can't believe my eyes  
When I see the truth  
And all the things I've done  
  
And every place, I'm queer  
I never stay, I run  
I know now why I live in shame  
  
Lame  
It's hard to sleep at night  
I hardly ever sleep at night

Uncle Kracker,Memphis Soul Song,/u/uncle+kracker/memphis+soul+song_20142141.html,"Looking back on everything  
And all the things that stay  
I can count on memories  
Because they don't go away  
Good times were hard to hold  
Until she came along  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
I'm not always there I know  
But she don't mind at all  
As pretty as a picture  
That hangs on my own wall  
She's like Mississippi  
When the sun comes up at dawn  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
With an angel on my left side  
And a devil on my right  
She's the one who saves me  
From them dark and holy nights  
Of all the ones who've left me  
It's a wonder she's not gone  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
She don't care what the game is  
She's always down to play  
My world without her  
Seems a million miles away  
She don't have to worry  
I know where I belong  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
I've been dealt some aces  
And I've played them all the same  
But she's the only one  
That keeps me in the game  
No fame or fortune  
Could ever keep me gone  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
With an angel on my left side  
And a devil on my right  
She's the one who saves me  
From them dark and holy nights  
Of all the ones who've left me  
It's a wonder she's not gone  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
There's a magic down in Memphis  
That never seems to fade  
Even now them voices carry  
Like a lonely serenade  
It's the memories that still  
And always will be on my mind  
They move me every time.  
  
She sees the good  
In everything there is to see  
Sometimes I wonder  
What she ever sees in me  
I'm not always right you know  
But she's never led me wrong  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
In all my travels  
I've never found a way  
To find the words that say  
The things I'd like to say  
I've sang some melodies  
But she's my favorite one  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
With an angel on my left side  
And a devil on my right  
She's the one who saves me  
From them dark and holy nights  
Of all the ones who've left me  
It's a wonder she's not gone  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.

Can't hold you back anymore  
Let it go, let it go

The snow glows white on the mountain tonight  
Not a footprint to be seen  
A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the queen  
The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside  
Couldn't keep it in  
Heaven knows I try  
  
Don't let them in, don't let them see  
Be the good girl you always have to be  
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know  
Well now they know  
  
Let it go, let it go  
Can't hold it back anymore  
Let it go, let it go  
Turn my back and slam the door  
And here I stand  
And here I'll stay  
Let it go, let it go  
The cold never bothered me anyway  
  
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small  
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all  
Up here in the cold thin air I finally can breathe  
I know left a life behind but I'm too relieved to grieve  
  
Let it go, let it go  
Can't hold it back anymore  
Let it go, let it go  
Turn my back and slam the door  
And here I stand  
And here I'll stay  
Let it go, let it go  
The cold never bothered me anyway  
  
Standing frozen in the life I've chosen  
You won't find me, the past is all behind me  
Buried in the snow  
  
Let it go, let it go  
Can't hold it back anymore  
Let it go, let it go  
Turn my back and slam the door  
And here I stand  
And here I'll stay  
Let it go, let it go  
The cold never bothered me anyway

Conversation is making the whole situation a plus  
Just figure it out  
Is we dealing wit us?  
Or do we capture that feeling that

I didn't what to tell her

Said she'd take a look at my palm  
Said ""Son, do you feel kind of warm?""  
And she looked into her crystal ball  
Said ""You're in love""  
  
Said it could not be so  
Not with all the girls I know  
Said when the next one arrives  
Looking into her eyes  
  
I left there in a hurry  
Much to my big surprise  
The next thing I discovered  
The fortune teller told me lies  
  
So I ran back to that woman  
Mad as I could be  
Told her I didn't see nobody  
How she made a fool out of me  
  
At last something shook me  
As if it came down from above  
And now the fortune teller  
And I fell in love

Well, I never thought that I could make it alone  
Thought I would die but I seem to carry on  
And I thought my life would surely leave  
And, though almost, I have not ceased to be  
And even though I thought I lost everything  
Today I found that the birds still sing in the morning  
And the world keeps spinning 'round  
And the world keeps spinning 'round  
When someone says goodbye, another dream ends  
And just before you give up another dream begins  
Someone changed their mind, tears fall to the ground  
But you know that one man's smile is another's frown  
And the table will turn someday, that's how life is  
I have no doubt 'cause you know that time don't stand still  
All the world keeps spinning 'round  
Yes, the world keeps spinning 'round  
Dawn will find me here and I think about  
One that I thought I couldn't live without  
One day she was here, the next day gone  
But the love that was never clear was just alone  
And how can you lose something you only thought  
That you found so you wipe away the tears with a smile  
All the world keeps spinning 'round  
Yes, the world keeps spinning 'round  
All the world keeps spinning 'round  
All the world keeps spinning 'round

Sting,Brand New Day,/s/sting/brand+new+day_20132019.html,"How many of you people out there  
Been hurt in some kind of love affair?  
And how many times did you swear  
That you'd never love again?  
How many lonely, sleepless nights?  
How many lies, how many fights?  
And why would you want to  
Put yourself through all of that again?  
Love is pain I hear you say  
Love has a cruel and bitter way of  
Paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain  
How could it be that what you need the most  
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?  
You never want to feel so sad and lost again  
One day you could be looking  
Through an old book in rainy weather  
You see a picture of her smiling at you  
When you were still together  
You could be walking down the street  
And who should you chance to meet  
But that same old smile you've been thinking of all day?  
Why don't we turn the clock to zero honey  
I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money  
We're starting up a brand new day  
Turn the clock all the way back  
I wonder if she'll take me back  
I'm thinking in a brand new way  
Turn the clock to zero sister  
You'll never know how much I missed her  
I'm starting up a brand new day  
Turn the clock to zero boss  
The river's wide we'll swim across  
We're starting up a brand new day  
It could happen to you,  
Just like it happened to me,  
There is simply no immunity  
There's no guarantee.  
I say love is such a force if you should find yourself in it  
You need some time for reflection  
You say, baby wait a minute, wait a minute  
Wait a minute, wait a minute  
Wait a minute, wait a minute  
Turn the clock to zero honey  
I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money  
We're starting up a brand new day  
Turn the clock to zero Mac  
I'm begging her to take me back  
I'm thinking in a brand new way  
Turn the clock to zero boss  
The river's wide we'll swim across  
Starting up a brand new day  
Turn the clock to zero buddy  
Don't wanna be no fuddy duddy  
We're starting up a brand new day  
I'm the rhythm in your tune  
I'm the sun and you're the moon  
I'm the bat and you're the cave  
You're the beach and I'm the wave  
I'm the plough and you're the land  
You're the glove and I'm the hand  
I'm the train and you're the station  
I'm the flagpole to your nation  
I'm the present to your future  
You're the wound and I'm the suture  
You're the magnet to my pole  
I'm the devil in your soul  
You're the pupil I'm the teacher  
You're the church and I'm the preacher  
You're the flower I'm the rain  
You're the tunnel I'm the train  
Stand up all you lovers in the world  
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl  
Stand up all you lovers in the world  
We're starting up a brand new day  
You're the crop to my rotation  
You're the sum of my equation  
I'm the answer to your question  
If you follow my suggestion  
We can turn this ship around  
And go up instead of down  
You're the pan and I'm the handle  
You're the flame and I'm the candle  
Stand up all you lovers in the world  
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl  
Stand up all you lovers in the world  
We're starting up a brand new day

I hear my heart beating  
And if only I could choose  
I'd stay here with you  
But hold me till the train is leaving  
  
Somewhere down the line  
After you've gone from sight  
Our love will be the same  
And, whispering your name,  
I'll cling to you with all my might  
  
Let me dream of you  
But it's true  
And wake me up when this is over  
Love will be there when this is over and  
  
Chorus:  
Somewhere far beyond today  
I will find a way to find you  
And somehow thru the lonely nights  
I will leave a light in the dark  
Let it lead you to my heart  
  
There's a love inside us  
Deep down inside  
That goes without saying  
Don't say a word  
But I'll tell you just the same  
And that love will fan the flame  
And that flame will warm the heart that's waiting  
  
You are mine and I'll wait for you my love  
You are mine it may take some time  
Even if it takes a lifetime  
Tell me you'll wait

And somewhere alone  
I will be praying you home  
I know that somewhere our love  
  
Our love will lead me to your arms

You know some kids ask us what happiness really is.  
Well, to me happiness is a hamburger, going to the movies, new clothes.  
Well, what's your happiness, gerard?  
  
Gerard:  
My happiness is a hotdog sandwich, new rubber shoes, new t-shirts,  
New jeans and also my favorite part of happiness is love.  
  
Lea:  
Happiness is two kinds of ice cream  
Finding your skate key, telling the time  
Happiness is learning to whistle  
Tying your shoe for the very first time  
Happiness is playing the drum in your own school band  
And happiness is walking hand in hand  
  
Gerard:  
Happiness is five different crayons  
Knowing a secret, climbing a tree  
Happiness is finding a nickel  
Catching a firefly, setting him free  
Happiness is being alone every now and then  
And happiness is coming home again

Happiness is morning and evening

Daytime and nighttime, too

Well, it's all up from Florida at the start of the spring,  
The trucks and the trailers will be winding  
Like a bullet we'll shoot for the carnival route.  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
From the Michigan mud past the Wisconsin sun  
'Cross that Minnesota border, keep 'em scrambling  
Through the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands,  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Hit Fargo on the jump and down to Aberdeen  
'Cross them old Black Hills, keep 'em rolling  
Through the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana.  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the white line on the highway sails under your wheels,  
I've gazed from the trailer window laughing.  
Oh, our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright.  
Following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-many a friend that follows the bend,  
The jugglers, the hustlers, the gamblers.  
Well, I've spent my time with the fortune-telling kind  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Oh, it's pound down the rails and it's tie down the tents,  
Get that canvas flag a-flying.  
Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the ferris wheel wind  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Well, it's roll into town straight to the fairgrounds  
Just behind the posters that are hanging  
And it's fill up every space with a different kind of face  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Get the dancing girls in front, get the gambling show behind,  
Hear that old music box a-banging.  
Hear them kids, faces, smiles, up and down the midway aisles  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-drag it on down by the deadline in the town,  
Hit the old highway by the morning  
And it's ride yourself blind for the next town on time  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttime  
Drinking red wine as we're rolling,  
Many a turnin' I turn, many a lesson I learn  
From following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
And it's roll back down to St. Petersburg  
Tie down the trailers and camp 'em  
And the money that we made will pay for the space  
From following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.

Because the cops don't need you and man they expect the same!

Although you died back in 1916

But here in this graveyard it's still no man's land  
The countless white crosses stand mute in the sand  
To man's blind indifference to his fellow man  
To a whole generation that were butchered and damned.  
  
Did they beat the drum slowly did they play the fife lowly  
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down  
Did the band play the last post and chorus  
Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest  
  
Now young willie mcbride I can't help wonder why  
Do those who lie here know why did they die  
Did they believe when they answered the call  
Did they really believe that this war would end wars  
Well the sorrow, the suffering, the glory, the pain  
The killing and the dying were all done in vain  
For young willie mcbride it all happened again,  
And again and again and again and again  
  
Did they beat the drum slowly did they play the fife lowly  
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down  
Did the band play the last post and chorus  
Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest

Alphaville,Change The World,/a/alphaville/change+the+world_20006888.html,"We can change the world...  
The difference is in the way...  
The difference is in the way we are as people  
The difference is the sum of what we are  
So look at the things that join us together  
And take away the things that pull us apart  
Ooh, we can change the world...  
The light that draws us through the tunnel of perception  
Is brighter than the light  
That makes us shield our eyes  
Just believe in the idea and it's purity  
No need to question it's source,  
No need for lies  
Ooh, we can change the world...  
Love of my life, we can change the world...  
We can change...  
Changes...  
The magnetism  
That you feel inside  
Draws you closer  
To the heart of the matter  
And the wisdom  
That you see outside  
Is only a mattter  
Of learning  
And forgetting  
Ooh, we can change the world...  
Love of my life, we can change the world...

Today is not made for laughter day  
This moment sacred is more for royal sunsets

Just another white trash  
County kiss  
Sixty one  
Long brown hair and foolish eyes  
He looks just like you want him to  
Some kind of slick chrome American prince  
A blue jean serenade  
And Moon River what'd you do to me  
And I don't believe you  
  
Saw Cinderella in a party dress but  
She was looking for a night gown  
I saw the devil wrapping up his hands  
He's getting ready for the show down  
I saw the minute that I turn away  
I got my money on a pond tonight  
  
Change came in disguised of revelation  
Set his soul on fire  
She said she'd always knew he'd come around  
And the decades disappear like sinking  
Ships we persevere god gives us hope  
But we still fear  
When we don't know  
The mind is poison castle in the sky  
Sit stranded vandalized  
The draw bridge is closing  
  
Saw Cinderella in a party dress but  
She was looking for a night gown  
I saw the devil wrapping up his hands  
He's getting ready for the show down  
I saw the ending were they turned the page  
I threw my money and I ran away  
Straight to the Valley of the great divide  
  
And were the dreams roll high  
And were the wind don't blow  
Out here the good girls die  
And the sky won't snow  
Out here the bird don't sing  
Out here the field don't grow  
Out here the bell don't ring  
Out here the bell don't ring  
Out here the good girls die  
  
Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep  
Its such a bitter form of refuge  
Ah don't you know the kingdoms under siege  
And everybody needs you  
Is there still magic in the midnight sun  
Or did you leave it back in sixty-one  
In the of the cadence in the young mans eyes  
And were the dreams roll high

On the soldiers by the side of the road  
There was a bright light, a shattering of shop windows  
The bomb in the baby carriage was wired to the radio  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
This is the long distance call  
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo  
The way we look to us all, oh yeah  
The way we look to a distant constellation  
Dying in a corner of the sky  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
Don't cry baby don't cry, don't cry  
It was a dry wind and it swept across the desert  
And it curled into the circle of birth  
And the dead sand falling on the children  
The mothers and the fathers and the automatic earth  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
This is the long distance call  
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo  
The way we look to us all, oh yeah  
The way we look to a distant constellation  
Dying in a corner of the sky

Don't cry baby don't cry, don't cry

It's every generation throws a hero up the pop chart  
Medicine is magical and magical is art  
Think of the Boy in the Bubble and the baby with the baboon heart  
And I believe there're lasers in the jungle  
Lasers in the jungle somewhere  
Staccato signals of constant information  
A loose affiliation of millionaires and billionaires

The way we look to us all, oh yeah  
The way we look to a distant constellation

System Of A Down,Suggestions,/s/system+of+a+down/suggestions_20134821.html,"Watching,  
From a post up high,  
From where you see the ships afar,  
From a well trained eye,  
The waves all keep on crashing by,  
If you are the light post,  
Then you own the working class,  
But if you want the answers,  
You better give a piece of ass,  
Give a piece of your ass  
  
Warning,  
Post hypnotic suggestions,  
Running the ships ashore,  
The orange light that follows,  
Will soon proclaim itself a God,  
If you point your questions,  
The fog will surely chew you up,  
But if you want the answers,  
You better get ready for the fire,  
Get ready for the fire  
  
The ships are multiplying day after day sir,  
And they're coming close to the shore sir, shore sir,  
We need to evacuate the light post,  
It's all over  
It's all over.

But I've been here before  
And I don't wanna be here again  
  
Ev'ry now and then  
voices on the wind  
call me back to the first time  
far away and clear  
you can hear the tear drops  
falling for the last in love.  
  
If I let you down  
All I can say is ""I'm sorry""  
Now it's' all over town  
So I don't want to hear it from you  
  
Please don't look away it's hard enough to say  
This could go on forever  
When the night is clear  
I can hear the teardrops  
Falling for the last in love.  
  
Every now and then  
I hear voices on the wind  
I may love you always and always  
Far away and clear  
You can hear the teardrops  
Falling for the last in love  
Calling for the last in love

There's no brakes on me, as I'm running down the track.  
They'll be waiting for me, but I'm never coming back.  
  
I'm going down  
To a place where I can see all there is to see in me.  
  
Bullets in the gun, gonna have some fun,

Hole is in the vein,  
Feel it numb the brain, take away the pain,  
Never be the same till I die.

There's no gauge to read,  
Peg the needle as I hit the black.

Modern day disease,  
Brings us to our knees, see them stand in line for a cure.  
Profit in the wind,  
Pushing back the time that we wait in line,  
Pushing back the time, it's a sin.

Mr. Mambo (repeat)  
I've been waiting for the weekend  
To go out and have some fun  
Well the stars shine just like sequins  
And my heart beats like a machine gun  
All my friends all need to party  
Most of them are on the floor  
Well I feel like I'm in heaven  
As that boy walks through the door  
Ooh I hope he notices  
And when he looks me in the eye  
Gotta have a beat now  
That's why I'm countin' on you  
Please Mr. Mambo  
Strike up the combo  
And let the music sway  
Please Mr. Mambo  
Just one more song now  
So we can shake the night away  
Here he comes so clean and ready  
As he's rockin' to the beat  
As he gets closer I'm breathin' heavy  
Lookin' down at my own feet  
An in a second he's right before me  
Askin' me for a dance  
I look up slowly, feelin' the glory  
As he takes me by the hand  
Ooh I wanna feel the rhythm  
Ooh I've gotta feel the groove now  
I know it's your decision  
That's why I'm countin' on you  
Please Mr. Mambo  
Just on sambo  
And let the music sway  
Please Mr. Mambo  
Just one more song so  
We can swing the night away  
  
Like it was Mardi Gras Night at the mall and everyone who was anybody was
there.  
There was some kind of like Limbo contest.  
Oh no, it was Mr. Natural Brazil, you know, no steroids.  
Oh and then like this gorgeous guy come up and asked me to dance.  
Well like I got so nervous I split my diet soft drink on him.  
Well that kind of bummed the evening out for us.  
And just as I was trying to dry him for off, the music started.  
Like I had never heard this type of music before.  
I had no experience with this strange beat.  
It sounded like they stole it from like the ""I Love Lucy"" show.  
And then like this guy came out.  
He was like so for sure, for sure.  
He had like wing tip shoes on and like this funny little red hat on.  
Like oh wow, that was the night Mr. Mambo changed my life.  
Mr. Mambo (repeat and fade with following)  
Please Mr. Mambo  
Strike up the combo  
And let this music sway  
Please Mr. Mambo  
Just one more song now  
So we can dance the night away  
Please Mr. Mambo  
Strike up the combo  
So we can shake the night away

Linkin Park,Step Up,/l/linkin+park/step+up_20083809.html,"Watch as the room rocks men only moon walk  
Mixed media slang, banging in your boom box  
Verbal violence, lyrical stylist  
In a time when rock hip hop rhymes are childish  
  
You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty  
Rapping to a beat doesn't make you an Emcee  
With your lack of skill and facility you're killing me  
And a DJ in the group just for credibility  
  
I heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes  
You're not an Emcee if someone else writes your lines  
And rapping over rock doesn't make you a pioneer  
'Cause rock and hip hop have collaborated for years  
  
But now they're getting randomly mixed and matched up  
All after a fast buck and all the tracks suck  
So how does it stack up? None of it's real  
You want to be an emcee you've got to study the skill  
  
Who can rock a rhyme like this?  
Bring it to you every time like this?  
Who can rock a rhyme like this?  
Step, step up, step, step up  
  
So you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity  
But mentally you don't have the hip hop energy  
With a tendency to make up stories  
Sounding like the only hip hop you've heard is top 40  
  
And your record company is completely missing it  
All the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate  
So in a battle you can't hack it, react with whack shit  
And get smacked with verbal back flips  
  
Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts  
It's taken decades for emcees to establish this  
You're new to hip hop and welcome if your serious  
But not on the mic leave that to the experienced  
  
Using the waves of sound the true master  
Paralyzes his opponents, leaving him vulnerable to attack  
  
Who can rock a rhyme like this?  
Bring it to you every time like this?  
Who can rock a rhyme like this?  
Step, step up, step, step up  
  
Who can rock a rhyme like this?  
Bring it to you every time like this?  
Who can rock a rhyme like this?  
Step, step up, step, step up, step up  
  
After years of pain staking research  
By the world's leading sound scientists  
We here at the sound institute have invented  
A reliable audio weapons system  
  
Actual movement of musical sound  
In space used to carefully attack and neutralize  
The cellular structure of the human body  
And the question must be asked  
  
Who can rock a rhyme like this?  
Bring it to you every time like this?  
Who can rock a rhyme like this?  
Step, step up, step, step up

Making a change in my heart  
Finding a new place to start  
Wondering what I can do  
Will I ever get over you... no  
When it comes to love  
I should know better  
When it comes to love  
I take the blame  
'cause you are the one I should've held on to  
When it comes to love  
Girl I can't help it  
When it comes to love  
I always lose my way  
And you are the one I should've held on to  
Ah, it could've been you

When our day begins  
And it feels like cold cold steel  
And when the sun comes up  
It's like a new commotion  
You say nobody told you  
It would feel like this  
  
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts  
  
You've got the killing gun  
Held in your hand  
It feels like cold cold steel  
And when the sun comes up  
It's like a new commotion  
You say shoot shoot shoot it up  
Shoot it up

Uncle Tupelo,Slate,/u/uncle+tupelo/slate_20247036.html,"A worn out joke to keep the flies away  
Carried it this far  
Got the west side winds to keep it steady  
We bury the hatchets we find  
  
Could carry that heavy load  
If I really thought it would matter  
Farcical hair appears  
As a blind side, clean the slate  
  
Working in the halls of shame  
Lay it down in full view  
Lay it down  
What the hell were we thinking  
  
Before the fire burned out?  
I can't find you now  
And I didn't know you then  
Loneliness drinks the bitters  
  
Till the cold winds warm again  
It's a feel for the game  
Mouth open wide, screams and hollers  
Working in the halls of shame  
  
Lay it down in full view  
Lay it down  
I gambled once and won, never made a dollar  
And beauty fades to grey  
  
And I pray the very best will guard her  
And provide the way  
It's a telltale sign  
When it's chairs up, and time to go  
  
Working in the halls of shame  
Lay it down in full view  
Lay it down

You make me prouder  
Than anything I ever could achieve  
And you make everything that used to seem so big  
Seem to be so small since you arrived  
  
On Angel's Wings, an angelical formation  
Angel's wings, like letters in the sky  
Now I know no matter what the question  
Love is the answer, it's written on Angel's Wings  
  
And I often wonder why, someone as flawed as I  
Deserves to be as happy as you make me  
So as the years roll by  
I'll be there by your side  
  
I'll follow you wherever your heart takes me  
'Cause you make everything that used to be so big  
Seem to be so small since you arrived  
  
On Angel's Wings, an angelical formation  
Angel's wings, like letters in the sky  
Now I know no matter what the question  
Love is the answer, it's written on Angel's Wings  
  
Now anyone who's felt the touch of heaven in their lives  
Will know the way I'm feeling looking in my baby's eyes  
That's why I can't bear to be too far away  
I know that God must love me cause he sent you to me on Angel's Wings

But oh, what I'd ever give to be the playboy of your dreams  
I'd tame your party heart, your fickle party heart

I am not worried, I am not overly concerned  
With the status of my emotions ""Oh"", She says, ""You're changing.""  
  
But we're always changing  
It does not bother me to say this isn't love  
Because if you don't want to talk about it then it isn't love  
And I guess I'm going to have to live with that  
But, I'm sure there's something in a shade of grey or something in between  
And I can always change my name if that's what you mean

But I'm not gonna break and I'm not going to worry about it anymore  
I'm not gonna bend and I'm not gonna break  
I'm not gonna worry about it anymore  
It seems like I should say ""as long as this is love...""  
But it's not all that easy so maybe I should just:  
Snap her up in a butter fly net and just pin her down on a photograph album  
I am not worried, I've done this sort of thing before  
But then I start to think about the consequences  
Because I don't get no sleep in a quiet room and...  
  
The time when kindness falls like rain  
It washes me away and Anna begins to change my mind  
And every time she sneezes I believe it's it's love and  
Oh lord.... I'm not ready for this sort of thing  
  
She's talking in her sleep  
It's keeping me awake and Anna begins to toss and turn  
And every word is nonsense but I understand and  
Oh lord... I'm not ready for this sort of thing  
  
Her kindness bangs a gong  
It's moving me along and Anna begins to fade away  
It's chasing me away  
She disappears and  
Oh lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

Squeeze,Tongue Like A Knife,/s/squeeze/tongue+like+a+knife_20129180.html,"The head of a hunt on the wall by a painting  
An upright piano stood locked by the door  
In through the window  
The light was fast fading  
While I split my whiskey  
All over the floor  
Making a mess of my words so  
I was trying  
To impress the Empress with  
My wimpy tales  
Fanning her face from cigar smoke  
And sighing  
I had come close to be miles  
From her trail  
  
She was the jewel that  
Sparkled in darkness  
She was the love  
Of everyone's life  
She was the catch at  
Everyone's parties  
She was the one with a tongue  
Like a knife  
  
Her bosoms curved perfectly  
Lit by the fire  
My mind launched away  
In a sea of its own  
Her grace and her tightness  
I had to admire  
Through a whore's breath of stories  
I happily told  
  
Trespassing my hand  
Fell into hot water  
She shot like a bullet  
Right out of her chair  
She led me away and I  
Was then slaughtered  
By the warmth of her body  
And her love and care  
  
Her tongue cut away  
And the wounds slowly opened  
I lay on the sails of the  
Ship of romance  
Drunk as I could be and  
Broker than broken and  
The head of my hunt  
Was there in my hands

Hoping everything works out  
'Cause I want them all to work out  
You were always so in love with the truth  
Why did you change?  
Why did you land?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Look at the photograph  
Nothing is real  
Spend another lonely life  
With nothing to feel  
  
Was it something  
In the stories everyone told you?  
You needn't heed them  
Maybe you should read them  
Go back to where you came from  
Why did you land?  
You couldn't have stayed in flight forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why did you land?  
Why did you land?  
Why did you land?  
Why did you land?  
Why did you land?

John Prine,New Train,/j/john+prine/new+train_20074782.html,"Full blown silence in an empty room  
A former bride and a former groom  
A folding table and a folding chair  
A folded hand of poker there  
All new directions must go everywhere  
Big round people in a cool little square  
You can't cut it with a boat or a plane  
Man it's gonna take a new train  
  
You'll be leaving on a new train  
Far away from this world of pain  
And when you look out your window you'll see  
Your home your baby and your family  
No melted ice cube in a paper cup  
Hell you'll be happy you'll be all shook up  
The friends that greet you will be  
Simple and plain  
When you step down from that new train  
  
Collected volumes of history say  
Man makes mistakes most everyday  
The half a pound of chopped ground round  
Is still a burger when it goes downtown  
No faded photographs of yesterdays  
Are in the books that I read these days  
To fly away from that memory town  
You must keep both your feet on the ground  
  
Cause you'll be leaving on a new train  
Far away from this world of pain  
And when you look out your window you'll see  
Your home your baby and your family  
No melted ice cube in a paper cup  
Hell you'll be happy you'll be all shook up  
The friends that greet you will be  
Simple and plain  
When you step down from that new train  
  
I'll be leaving on a new train  
Far away from this world of pain  
The friends that greet me will be  
Simple and plain  
When I step down from that new train  
New train, new train.

Deep in your private dream  
Two ways to go from here  
One way will bring you near  
Fragile wish  
  
Full moon, no rain, no shame  
That distance still remains  
More shades of grey to come  
We've been through more than one  
Close your eyes  
  
Like a frightened child  
Fragile in spirit  
Like a wind blowin' wild  
No name you can give it  
Like an infant I see in the light for the very first time  
  
No tricks, no slight of hand  
Find somewhere safe to land  
Before your walls were shaken  
But now the whole thing's brakin'  
And it makes you feel  
  
Like a frightened child  
Fragile in spirit  
Like a wind blowin' wild  
No name you can give it  
Like an infant I see in the light for the very first time  
  
Yes, your right  
What is right?  
Yes it's night I can tell  
  
Yes it shows  
Yes I know

Howard Jones,Love's Never Wasted,/h/howard+jones/loves+never+wasted_20715475.html,"I remember the day we met  
Like a thunderbolt out of the blue  
You kinda liked the way I came across  
But it always meant more to me than it meant to you  
  
Recalling a daydream I had as a child  
A half hidden memory from a more innocent time  
  
Your love is never wasted  
If your heart is true  
All that you're giving  
Will always come back to you  
In the strangest of ways  
On your darkest of days  
All that you're giving out  
Will surely be coming back to you  
  
So no need to be worrying  
No need to count the cost  
No separating the inside from the outside world  
No finding No loss  
  
I'm remembering something, so distant so fine  
Ancient, eternal and still ahead of it's time  
  
Your love is never wasted  
If that love is true  
All that you're giving  
Will always come back to you  
In the strangest of ways  
In your darkest of days  
All that you're giving out  
Will surely be coming back to you  
  
So love with abandon  
Without judgement. Without fear  
With a confidence in tomorrow  
Love with a grin and a tear  
  
Not always reflected, not always fulfilled  
Love's not out to get you but wants you to build  
  
Your love is never wasted  
If that love is true  
All that you're giving  
Will always come back to you  
In the sweetest of ways  
On your brightest of days  
All that you're giving out  
Will surely be coming back to you  
Surely be coming back to you

Yet no distance

Behind the fear

No matter what her father say, baby gon' see me  
It's like a jungle sometimes, that makes me Wonder like Stevie  
Believe me, when I say that baby was in love with a thug  
In love with a thug

I'm caught up in the middle and I don't know what to do  
I caught eight months in the joint, behind my crew  
That I gotta do and I'ma miss you Boo  
But I'ma write you every night and call you on the phone too  
What you gon' do? ""You know I'm goin' stay true  
But I'ma go ahead to college like my father want me to""  
Well um, off to my cell with ya body on my mind  
And I'ma call you back tomorrow round the same time  
I'm on the mainline, 9500 for short  
On another phone line, holla'n at my other hoe  
This bitch ain't saying shit, cause the bitch ain't shit  
Old fat gold-digging-ass county check receiving bitch  
I bail up in the Day Room and get in a scrap  
Niggas watching Soul Train and I wouldn't turn it back (man fuck y'all)  
Never caught slipping, always on strap  
And now I'm back in the hole with no motherfucking getback  
Sit back and contemplate, and think about baby  
And hope she don't get caught up in the world that's so crazy  
But while I'm up in Wayside, and she off in college  
She getting a little mo' than a schoolgirl knowledge  
Cause gangsta-ass niggas go to school nowadays  
I tried to make you wait, but I can't change yo' ways  
She fell in love with the local G  
And now they both in the penitentiary, she didn't mention me

They possess you, bless you, sunshine, now you can never let them down, I say
sunshine.  
  
Sunshine, sunshine, is that a cloud across your smile or did you dream again
last night?  
It's best you rest inside a while as blue doesn't seem to suit you right.  
  
Things ain't what they used to be, pain and rain and misery.  
Illness in the family and sunshine means a lot to me, I say sunshine.  
  
But could it be Sunshine is drifting with midnight and lonely when everyone's
gone?  
Blue crystal spirits and gardens in moonlight  
Leave weak alone and bleak all quiet and grey by dawn.  
  
Sunshine, sunshine rising to late to chase the cold and failing to change the
frost to dew.  
She's trading her mood of yellow gold for frost bitten shades of silver-blue.  
  
Friends and lovers past and gone and no one waiting further on,  
I'm running short of things to be and sunshine means quiet a lot to me, I say
sunshine.

To caress the river with awe  
Within there's every little memory resting calm with me  
Resting in a dream  
Smiling back at me  
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home

You are the land in my dark closet  
Stay by my side until it goes dark forever  
When silent the silence comes closer

As the waters cover the sea,  
So Your love covers me  
Guiding me on,  
Roads unkown  
I trust in You alone  
  
Chorus  
My Saving Grace  
My endless love  
Deeper and deeper I'm falling in love with You  
My one desire  
My only truth  
Deeper and deeper I'm falling in love with you  
  
Bridge  
And I will rise on wings of eagles  
Soaring high above all my fears  
I rest in Your open arms of love

Beneath the shadows of a cold crescent moon  
I watched her leaving no shouting or screaming  
Just the sound of our hearts as they fall out of tune  
  
Angels don't fly they just walk out the door  
I know cause her footsteps I still hear on my floor  
You migh thtink I'm crazy but I know it's true  
Angels don't fly they just walk out on you  
  
Now I'm lost in my memories and smoky nights bring me  
As close to the truth as any man should ever be  
Seems the love that I gave her could never quite save her  
From a wild, restless heart that just had to be free  
  
Angels don't fly they just walk out the door  
I know cause her footsteps I still hear on my floor  
You might think I""m crazy but I know it's true  
Angels don't fly they just walk out on you

Hold your head up high now, there's no need to cry now  
We're not running anymore  
  
Leave the politics behind boys, they're not working anymore  
There's so much more at stake here, it's make or break here  
Haven't we been here before - tell me what we're waiting for

You still have the freedom to learn, and say what you want to say  
You gotta remember, don't let 'em take away  
The land we call the home of the brave  
  
Who sings the song of the people, you don't hear it anymore  
I heard it late last summer, to the beat of a different drummer  
It never sounded quite like that before  
  
So you're trying to shake this feeling, that trouble's right outside the door  
You lie awake each dark night, like a time bomb wound up too tight  
A storm in waiting, just offshore - tell me what we're waiting for

Bread,Diary,/b/bread/diary_20023948.html,"I found her diary underneath a tree.  
And started reading about me  
The words she's written took me by surpise  
You'd never read them in her eyes.  
They said that she had found the love she waited for.  
Wouldn't you know it, she wouldn't show it.  
  
When she confronted with the writing there,  
Simply pretended not to care.  
I passed it off as just in keeping with  
Her total disconcerting air  
And though she tried to hide  
The love that she denied,  
Wouldn't you know it, she wouldn't show it.  
  
And as I go through my life, I will give to her my wife  
All the sweet things that I can find.  
  
I found her diary underneath a tree.  
And started reading about me.  
The words began stick and tears to flow.  
Her meaning now was clear to see.  
The love she'd waited for was someone else not me  
Wouldn't you know it, she wouldn't show it.  
  
And as I go through my life, I will wish for her his wife  
All the sweet things that she can find  
All the sweet things they can find

I made her open for me,  
I took her heart,  
And I kissed it clean,  
But she still kicks against me.  
Are the songs my disease?  
Are the songs my disease?  
Maybe she's creating me,  
Mistaken accidentally,  
For a girl I used to know,  
In darkness permanently,  
If I find her the perfect line,  
My sickness might desert me.  
Are the songs my disease?  
Are the songs my disease?

With money in my pocket  
Sometimes I get it free

While you're bleeding to death  
And somebody else is always  
Breathing down your neck

Another rock and roll widow since they gunned him down

As night began to fall

In answer to the call  
The band played on in darkness  
Not knowing what to do  
As people ran from side to side  
Just looking for a clue

So hard to move on  
Still loving what's gone

Carries on and on and on and on

Is the empty, empty page  
While the final rattle rocks  
It's empty, empty cage  
And I can't handle this

In all the dogs and cats  
In the flies and rats  
In the rot and the rust  
In the ashes and the dust

Life carries on and on and on  
Life carries on and on and on and on

The home we reside in  
The face that we hide in  
The way we are tied in

Life carries on and on and on

Or did I believe this dream?  
Now I will find relief

So let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P

See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes, until you in conversation it
comes out in a line so let it  
Out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), my nigga let it out  
[Verse 2]  
Aye yo, 10 21 Atlantis drive, nigga was action packed  
That's Atlantis apartments, we live in half the back  
That's where the 12 year olds there, they wbe flashing crack  
And when they shoot you nigga, they ain't tryna pass it back  
Aye yo, Diggy, Fleet and Marvian can you imagine that?  
The place we love the most, the hood was built to smash us flat  
But I escaped 'cause I chased, what made me passion that  
Now I got my skate team and spit these acid raps  
So many niggas will rise  
So many them niggas try  
So many them niggas ended up duck-taped and tied  
So many them same niggas, man they moms eyes cry  
So, they just got older, still on the corner with they pride  
Well let me tell niggas something, I'm so glad you alive  
Long as you got a breathe, a pulse, nigga strive  
Devine intervention this is  
I heard a voice nigga, listen to this  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3]  
Jesus will arange it, but Jesus won't change it  
Hold yourself responsible, on yourself you blame it  
You mad, nigga don't articulate and ??,  
I.E. we best friends, speak best friends language  
I'm a happy nigga, you can't approach me in anguish  
Whoever said anything worth working for would be painless  
Can't be mad at the world 'cause you and your girl ain't famous  
'cause you both on bate, BBC and chainless  
Also your rangless, therefore switch laneless  
Now you brainless, dangerous, 'cause you pull out the stainless  
All of sudden you smart, now you do something hainess  
First time you get caught, now your ass is famous  
No longer chainless, and the bus switching lanes is a bad look  
Yo girl with ya man sellin' laneless, Stop  
Nigga rewind and reverese slides 3 times  
Reassess your thinking and trust me it'll be fine  
First pitcure your goal, and repeat 'It'll be mine'  
Or fuck it nigga, just keep imagine killin' me fine  
Now you, scruntching your face tryna ace attainment  
When you should be tryna find a place to base your shame, nigga  
Success is taingeable, don't wait for fame  
I thought you would receive it better if I ain't say ya name  
You unsure of yourself, sit still and think  
Review those actions if it fit, put your name in the blank  
[Chorus]  
Star Track, is who we are [x4]

Ozzy Osbourne,Alive,/o/ozzy+osbourne/alive_20103939.html,"A child of a broken mind

what keeps me alive is dreams

I'll find the key that sets my mind free

I'm not here to try and make excuses

Comes like a comet  
Suckered you but not your friends

And teach you how to be a holy cow

Is that you do it to yourself  
Just you and no one else  
You do it to yourself

Don't get my sympathy

You've changed the locks three times  
He still comes reeling through the door  
One day I'll get you  
And teach you how to get to purest hell

Alphaville,Do The Strand,/a/alphaville/do+the+strand_20190617.html,"There's a new sensation, a fabulous creation  
A danceable solution to teenage revolution  
Do the strand, love, when you feel love  
It's the new way, that's why we say  
Do the strand  
Do it on the tables, Quaglino's place or Mabel's  
Slow and gentle, sentimental  
All styles served here, Louis seize he prefers  
Laissez-faire le Strand  
Tired of the tango, fed up with Fandango  
Dance on moonbeams, slide on rainbows  
In furs or blue jeans, you know what i mean  
Do the strand  
  
We're playing our tune by the pale moon  
We're incognito down the Lido  
And we like the strand  
Had your fill of quadrilles, the madison and cheap thrills  
Bored with the beguine, the samba isn't your scene  
If you feel blue look through who's who  
See La Goulue and Nijinsky  
Do the strandsky  
Weary of the waltz, mashed potato schmaltz  
The Sphinx and Mona Lisa, Lolita and Guernica  
Rhododendron is a nice flower  
Evergreen it lasts forever  
But it can't beat the strand power  
Do the strand

You are not the plan  
And your beginning to annoy

You will never know eternal peace  
The places promised by your faith  
The God you love is gone  
He lies broken by your shame  
The thing that took His place already died  
Send black Angels for you  
It will send Angels  
I am just a voice  
Only you are pure enough for truth  
That no-one else will hear  
And then tear away belief  
You must write 'The Book'  
Only you can save the light of man

Send black Angels for you

Is it only a storm approaching  
All that thunder and the blinding light

Billy Joel,You May Be Right,/b/billy+joel/you+may+be+right_20072916.html,"Friday night I crashed your party  
Saturday I said I'm sorry  
Sunday came and trashed me out again  
I was only having fun  
Wasn't hurting any one  
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change  
  
I was stranded in the combat zone  
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone  
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain  
And you told me not to drive  
But I made it home alive  
So you said that only proves that I'm insane  
  
You may be right  
I may be crazy  
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for  
Turn out the light  
Don't try to save me  
You may be wrong for all I know  
But you may be right  
  
Remember how I found you there  
Alone in your electric chair  
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled  
You were lonely for a man  
I said take me as I am  
Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while  
  
Now think of all the years you tried to  
Find someone to satisfy you  
I might be as crazy as you say  
If I'm crazy then it's true  
That it's all because of you  
And you wouldn't want me any other way  
  
You may be right  
I may be crazy  
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for  
It's too late to fight  
It's too late to change me  
You may be wrong for all I know  
But you may be right  
  
You may be right  
I may be crazy  
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for  
Turn out the light  
Don't try to save me

There will be a lover tonight  
  
(Check it out)  
  
You're the real thing  
Yeah the real thing  
You're the real thing  
Even better than the real thing  
  
Give me one last chance  
And I'm gonna make you sing  
Give me half a chance  
To ride on the waves that you bring  
  
You're honey child to a swarm of bees  
Gonna blow right through you like a breeze  
Give me one last chance  
We'll slide down the surface of things  
  
You're the real thing  
Yeah the real thing  
You're the real thing  
Even better than the real thing  
  
We're free to fly the crimson sky  
The sun won't melt our wings tonight  
  
Oh now  
Here she comes  
  
Take me higher  
Take me higher  
Can you take me higher?  
Will you take me higher?  
  
You're the real thing  
Yeah the real thing

Josh Groban,The First Noel,/j/josh+groban/the+first+noel_20661246.html,"The First Noel, the Angels did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay  
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel!  
  
They looked up and saw a star  
Shining in the East beyond them far  
And to the earth it gave great light  
So it continued both day and night.  
  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel!

Born is the King, Born is the King, Born is the King of Israel!

Kenny Rogers,Love Lifted Me,/k/kenny+rogers/love+lifted+me_20248253.html,"I was sinking deep in sin,  
Far from the peaceful shore,  
Very deeply stained within,  
Sinking to rise no more.  
But the Master of the sea  
  
Heard my despairing cry,  
From the waters lifted me.  
Now safe am I.  
  
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!  
When nothing else could help,  
Love lifted me.  
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!  
When nothing else could help  
Love lifted me.  
  
Souls in danger look above  
Jesus completely saves  
He will lift you by his love  
Out of the angry waves  
  
But the master of the sea  
Billows His will obey  
He your savior wants to be  
Be saved today  
  
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!  
When nothing else could help,  
Love lifted me.  
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!  
When nothing else could help  
Love lifted me.

Some place so high above this wall.

Any day now, any day now,  
I shall be released.  
  
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,  
Is a man who swears he's not to blame.  
All day long I hear him shout so loud,  
Crying out that he was framed.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west unto the east.  
Any day now, any day now,  
I shall be released.

Upon the street where mothers weep  
The saviours who are fast asleep  
They wait for you  
And I wait for them to interrupt  
Me drinkin from my broken cup  
And askin me to open up the gate for you

He spoke to me, I took his flute  
No, I wasn't very cute to him now was I

Because he took you for a ride  
And because time was on his side  
And because I want you, baby I want you

How you have opened my eyes  
I sure have tried about thousand times

Horrible Histories,Norman Family Tree,/h/horrible+histories/norman+family+tree_21067102.html,"[Intro]  
Here's the tale of me, Matilda,  
And my fight with cousin Stephen to succeed  
Henry first's throne.  
My wife's also called Matilda,  
Quite confusing 'cause we choose to claim  
Matilda's throne as our own.  
I'm Henry that Matilda's son.  
You got that?  
Here's the story of our spat.  
  
[Verse 1]  
Starts in 1135, when king Henry, my father, died,  
And I think you'll find named me, Matilda, as his heir.  
But his nephew, Stephen, said  
That crown should be upon my head!  
I'm a man and men come first.  
What? It's only fair.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Had married Geoffrey of Anjou,  
Stuck in France not Waterloo.  
When Steve without a voulez vous,  
Took throne from me.  
Should be dancing queen.  
Oh stop causing such a scene!  
  
[Chorus]  
Gimme, gimme crown and take a chance on me,  
I'm heir to the throne not you! Ah-ha!  
Think you'll get it back,  
Now that I'd like to see!  
  
Oh, I do, I do, I do!  
  
[Verse 3]  
Fought in Lincoln,  
She caught me.  
Was proclaimed first English Lady.  
But she made many enemies.  
Remember me? I'm Stephens wife.  
  
[Verse 4]  
Made royal councilors agree,  
That she lacked femininity.  
Took Stephens army and besieged her.  
Eugh! More strife!  
  
[Verse 5]  
I was trapped so faked my death!  
Hid in coffin, held my breath.  
Escaped!  
You think that I'm impressed?  
Well I'm not.  
Just look who I've got,  
Your half brother, want to swap?  
  
[Chorus]  
Gimme, gimme hubby and we'll fight again.  
The winner takes it all. Ah-ha!  
In Oxford I'll besiege,  
And I'll escape and then,  
I'll join the battle call.  
  
[Verse 6]  
Age 14, I fought but lost,  
So Uncle Stephen stayed as boss.  
Who should be ruler, mamma? Mia!  
Here we go again.  
  
[Verse 7]  
Sadly my darling Matilda,  
Caught a fever and it killed her.  
I gave up my dream  
To build a royal dynasty.  
When my son died,  
Had no heir which was a bind.  
  
[Chorus]  
Gimme, gimme crown 'cause next in line it's me.  
You can have it when I'm done. Ah-ha!  
So Empress Matilda never did make queen.  
The throne went to my son.  
  
Knowing Mum, knowing you.  
Everybody happy? Good!

But I know that I will one day have you back  
And the hills are as soft as a pillow  
And they cast a shadow on my bed  
And the view when I look through my window  
Is an altar piece I'm praying to for the living and the dead  
Twin valley shines in the morning sun  
I send a message out to my only one  
I been locked out and I know we're through  
But I can't begin to face up to the truth  
I wait so long for the walls to crack  
But I know that I will one day have you back

Every night I circle like the moon  
It's an act of simple devotion  
But it can take forever when you've got something to prove

For us to break in two

Who can love you like I do

But this time I won't cry  
Where are you now  
Are you with another love  
It's not the first time  
You stood me up and let me down  
I, I, I'm wondering why  
  
I still love you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi  
I still want you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi  
  
Did you believe I'd let you down  
Your jealous heart  
Gave you the runaround  
You couldn't see that  
I would always be a friend  
If you could look inside your heart  
And understand what's tearing you apart  
You gotta trust someone  
Don't let hate get in the way  
  
Just turn it into love  
Turn it into love  
And open up your heart  
And you'll never feel ashamed  
If you turn it, turn it  
Turn it into love  
  
In my imagination  
There is no complication  
I dream about you all the time  
In my mind of celebration  
The sweetest of sensation  
Thinking you could be mine  
In my imagination  
There is no hesitation  
We walk together hand in hand  
I'm dreaming  
  
You fell in love with me  
Like I'm in love with you  
But dreaming's all I do  
If only they'd come true  
  
I should be so lucky  
Lucky, lucky, lucky  
I should be so lucky in love  
I should be so lucky  
Lucky, lucky, lucky  
I should be so lucky in love  
  
You keep on asking me  
Why can't we be together  
I keep saying  
Won't you wait a while  
What's all the hurry  
I thought we had forever  
I just need time  
Till I can make up my mind  
  
I'm not asking for  
A love to last forever  
I don't expect  
To get a guarantee  
It's just that I believe  
Lovers should stick together  
I'm only saying  
Won't you wait for me  
  
I've got to be  
Got to be certain  
I've got to be so sure  
I've had my share  
Of hearts broken  
And I don't wanna take that anymore  
  
All aboard!

Deep Purple,Jack Ruby,/d/deep+purple/jack+ruby_20038655.html,"There's no method in my madness, no craft, no guile  
No expertise, no self assuring smile  
No wizardry or witchcraft, no crass deceit  
No dark conspiracies, I stand on my own two feet  
I'm coming through just like jack ruby  
  
I ragged around the edges but I got control  
There's no way around it and I got control  
I reach out for my program, still got control  
Straight down to business, who needs control  
I've got panache just like jack ruby  
  
I don't beg forgiveness, I don't beg at all  
But I beg to differ 'cause I got the ball  
There was no invitation, you're not my type  
And what's gone, it ain't worth having, kiss it all goodbye  
Right on the money just like jack ruby

Above earth's lamentations,  
I hear the real, though far-off hymn  
That hails a new creation.  
  
Through all the tumult and the strife  
I hear it's music ringing,  
It sounds an echo in my soul.  
How can I keep from singing?  
  
While though the tempest loudly roars,  
I hear the truth, it liveth.  
And though the darkness 'round me close,  
Songs in the night it giveth.  
  
No storm can shake my inmost calm,  
While to that rock I'm clinging.  
Since love is lord of heaven and earth  
How can I keep from singing?  
  
When tyrants tremble in their fear  
And hear their death knell ringing,  
When friends rejoice both far and near  
How can I keep from singing?  
  
In prison cell and dungeon vile  
Our thoughts to them are winging,  
When friends by shame are undefiled  
How can I keep from singing?

Close to the point where angels fear to tread

And every beaten path is just another winding road  
That tempts me far from you and all that's true

Some say love, it is a razor, that leaves your soul to bleed  
Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need  
I say love, it is a flower, and you, it's only seed  
  
It's the heart afraid of breaking, that never learns to dance  
It's the dream afraid of waking, that never takes the chance  
It's the one who won't be taken, who can not seem to give  
And the soul afraid of dying, that never learns to live  
  
When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long  
And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong  
Just remember in the winter, far beneath the bitter snow  
Lies the seed, that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the rose.

All the world loves a clown  
Show 'em tricks, tell 'em jokes  
And you'll only stop with top folks  
  
Be a crack Jackanapes  
And they'll imitate you like apes  
Why be a great composer with your rent in arrears  
Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years  
When crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears  
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown  
  
Be a clown, be a clown  
All the world loves a clown  
If you just make 'em roar  
Watch your Mounte bank account soar  
  
Wear a painted mustache  
And you're sure to make a big splash  
A college education I should never propose  
A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes  
But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose  
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown  
  
Give 'em quips, give 'em fun  
And they'll happy to say you're A-1  
If you become a farmer you've the weather to buck  
If you become a gambler you'll be stuck with your luck  
But Jack you'll never lack if you can quack like a duck  
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

There's a cutting edge there's a real fine line  
And it's caught in come and go  
And you're leaving what you thought you knew  
To what you've come to know  
When the twilight turns at the end of day  
And the angels kiss the moon  
There's a diamond sun everywhere she goes  
And there ain't no other way  
I'm gonna dream tonight  
By that pale moonlight  
Till the morning comes my way  
  
I'm walking tall  
And I'm walking fine  
And I'm up there  
With that girl of mine  
  
And I'm standing in the twilight now

Underneath that midnight sky

You didn't have to be so mad  
When you ran across the road  
The light alone soon told me  
You had a heavy load  
But I can't see why you didn't stay  
Why you didn't come to see if I felt  
The same way  
And I do, and I do  
I never asked for any comfort  
To take up your time  
But now I feel so very different  
I need to make you mine  
And I want to take what you have to  
Give me  
And bring you the words that fall  
From my head  
And I will, and I will  
I know you better than you think  
And always will  
Know you better than you think  
And always will, always will  
I know you better than you think

Genesis,Harlequin,/g/genesis/harlequin_20058819.html,"Came the night a mist dissolved the trees  
And in the broken light colors fly, fading by.  
Pale and cold as figures fill the glade  
Grey is the web they spin, on and on, and on and on.  
Through the flame still summer lingers on  
Though her pictures soon shatter.  
  
All, always the same.  
But there appears in the shades of dawning,  
Though your eyes are dim,  
All of the pieces in the sky.  
  
There was once a harvest in this land.  
Reap from the turquoise sky, harlequin, harlequin,  
Dancing round, three children fill the glade,  
Theirs was the laughter in the winding stream, and in between.  
Close your door, the picture fades again  
From the flames in the firelight.  
  
All, always the same,  
But there appears in the shades of dawning,  
Though your eyes are dim,  
All of the pieces in the sky.  
  
All, all is not lost,  
And light appears in the shades of dawning  
When your eyes can see  
Order the pieces, put them back, put them back.

Hold up that old checker flag for 'em  
Chalk lines by the do not park sign

Saturday morning had to rake the leaves, awww shit  
Watch how they pile up  
Seem like a mile up  
I was the blisters on my hand than I dial up my best friend  
Skating ring is where we headed tonight  
And if a n-gga disrespect, yes we ready to fight  
In retrospect that shit seemed petty  
At the time, the shit was heavy  
Cause life was all about your name  
You had to scrap with any n-gga that would call you lame  
Ashamed no doubt, so many n-ggas go they brains blown out  
Snatched a n-gga chain and he got his name rolled out in obituaries  
Another body in a cemetary  
Another young n-gga in the penetentiary  
And he don't give a f-ck no missionary  
Rap visionary, paint a picture n-gga pictionary  
Tell you what it is, I'm a dictionary  
I knew a n-gga that threw his d-ck in every chick in every city that he went
to  
Went hard like the rent do  
Till he met the wrong bitch, man just came home ex-convict  
And he stay on with that thriller

Show me, show me, show me  
  
Sail on a sea of Pepsi Cola shaken at sunrise  
Kiss the boy and then employ a very white disguise  
Who had asked you to consider, you are not so fly  
In the city they will snigger, ask them why  
  
Saved by this parade of passion was my company  
Gave my life for next to nothing, a sane artillery  
Is one that kisses 2 be clever, who is the enemy?  
It's not me, not me, no, not you, not me  
It's not you, not me, no, not you then who?

Are drifting through my open mind,  
Possessing and caressing me.

Supertramp,Lord Is It Mine,/s/supertramp/lord+is+it+mine_20133847.html,"I know that there's a reason why I need to be alone  
I need to find a silent place that I can call my own  
Is it mine, Lord is it mine?  
When everything's dark and nothing seems right,  
There's nothing to win and there's no need to fight  
I never cease to wonder at the cruelty of this land  
But it seems a time of sadness is a time to understand  
Is it mine, Lord is it mine?  
When everything's dark and nothing seems right,  
You don't have to win and there's no need to fight  
If only I could find a way  
To feel your sweetness through the day  
The love that shines around me could be mine.  
So give us an answer, won't you,  
We know what we have to do,  
There must be a thousand voices trying to get through.

Judy Garland,If Love Were All,/j/judy+garland/if+love+were+all_20491994.html,"I believe in doing what I can  
In crying when I must  
In laughing when I choose  
Hey ho, if love were all  
  
I should be lonely.  
I believe the more you love a man,  
The more you give your trust,  
The more you're bound to lose.  
  
Although when shadows fall  
I think if only  
Somebody splendid really needed me  
Someone affectionate and dear  
  
Cares would be ended if I knew that he  
Wanted to have me near.  
But I believe that since my life began  
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse.  
Hey ho, if love were all.

Indigo Girls,Power Of Two,/i/indigo+girls/power+of+two_20067270.html,"Now the parking lot is empty  
Everyone's gone someplace  
I pick you up and in the trunk I've packed  
A cooler and a 2-day suitcase  
Cause there's a place we like to drive  
Way out in the country  
Five miles out of the city limit we're singing  
And your hand's upon my knee  
  
So we're okay  
We're fine  
Baby I'm here to stop your crying  
  
Chase all the ghosts from your head  
I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed  
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart  
We'll look at them together then we'll take them apart  
Adding up the total of a love that's true  
Multiply life by the power of two  
  
You know the things that I am afraid of  
I'm not afraid to tell  
And if we ever leave a legacy  
It's that we loved each other well  
'Cause I've seen the shadows of so many people  
Trying on the treasures of youth  
But a road that fancy and fast ends  
Ends in a fatal crash  
And I'm glad we got off  
To tell you the truth  
  
'Cause we're okay  
We're fine  
Baby I'm here to stop your crying  
Chase all the ghosts from your head  
I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed  
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart  
We'll look at them together then we'll take them apart  
Adding up the total of a love that's true  
Multiply life by the power of two  
  
All the shiny little trinkets of temptation  
(Make new friends)  
Something new instead of something old  
(But keep the old)  
All you gotta do is scratch beneath the surface  
(But remember what is gold)  
And it's fools gold  
(What is gold)  
Fools gold  
(What is gold)  
Fools gold  
  
Now we're talking about a difficult thing  
And your eyes are getting wet  
I took us for better and I took us for worse  
Don't you ever forget it  
Now the steel bars between me and a promise  
Suddenly bend with ease  
The closer I'm bound in love to you  
The closer I am to free  
  
So we're okay  
We're fine  
Baby I'm here to stop your crying  
Chase all the ghosts from your head  
I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed  
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart  
We'll look at them together then we'll take them apart  
Adding up the total of a love that's true

I said ""Timber, ho!"", timber, woah this timber's gotta roll

Been everywhere and he ain't no fool  
Weighed nine hundred and twenty-two  
Done everything a poor mule can do

Jerry's shoulders stood six foot tall  
Pulled more timber than a freight could haul  
Workin' heavy old Jerry got sore  
Pulled so much he couldn't pull no more

The boss said ""Jerry"" and it made him jump  
Jerry ran and kicked the boss on the rump  
My old Jerry was a cool mule  
Had it been me I woulda killed that fool

Jerry took that bullet and he stomped him dead  
Stomped that boss til he heard him scream  
Sure don't care he was so damn mean

We got a lot of work to be done  
  
Go get your marbles put 'em in the house  
Tear down your castles in the sand  
Come with your poppy to the cotton patch  
Get a little dirt on your hands, get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands, son

Get a little dirt on your hands

Well, I reached twenty-one  
And I thought I was a pretty big wheel  
I left the country for the city  
Met a slicker with a shady deal  
  
He said, ""Hold up the bank, boy and take all the money  
And run as fast as you can  
The only way you'll ever get along in this world  
Is to get a little dirt on your hands, get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands, son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you want to grow up to be a big, big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands""  
  
Well, it's four in the morning  
And the warden is calling' my name  
He said he's teaching' me a lesson  
Now he's making' me go work in the rain  
  
Dig that ditch, boy, fill it up  
I'm wanting you to understand  
The only way to straighten out a guy like you  
Is to get a little dirt on his hands, get a little dirt on his hands  
  
Hey, David got to get a little dirt on those hands boy  
Yeah, if you want to grow up to be a big, big man  
You better remember what old Whispering Bill  
Told you in this song, get a little dirt on those hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands, son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you want to grow up to be a big, big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands, son  
I got a little dirt on my hands

It never could work out  
The time to make plans  
Has passed, faded away  
Oh the way you look  
Makes my starry eyes shiver  
Then I look away  
Too much for one day  
One thing we share  
Is an ideal of beauty  
  
Treasure so rare  
That even devils might care  
Your swimming-pool eyes  
In sea breezes they flutter  
The coconut tears  
Heavy-lidded they shed  
Swaying palms at your feet  
You're the pride of your street  
While you worship the sun  
Summer lover of fun  
Gold number with neighbours  
Who said that you'll go far  
Maybe someday be a star  
A fast mover like you  
And your dreams will all come true  
  
All of my hope, and my inspiration  
I drew from you  
Our life's pattern's drawn in sand  
But the winds could not erase  
The memory of your face  
Deep in the night  
Plying very strange cargo  
Our soul-ships pass by  
Solo trips to the stars, in the sky  
Gliding so far  
That the eye cannot follow  
Where do they go  
We'll never know

About you

Friends.

And he finds himself  
Spread-eagled on the tracks  
But the training that he learned  
Will get him nowhere fast.  
  
And I know we  
Should be free  
But freedom's just  
A prison to me  
'Cause I lied  
To keep it kind  
When I left you  
Far behind.  
  
With the rain  
Pounding on his  
Back he recalls  
The moment that  
He cracked long  
Ago in the museum  
With his friends.  
And like those  
Memories the rain  
Keeps pounding  
Down, down, down.

Have turned to stone  
I can fly fly fly away.  
Watch me fly above the city  
Like a shadow on the sky.  
Fly, fly, fly.

But it's no game, though it just might be a dream  
  
Highest hill to lowest pit  
If you ain't got love, you ain't got shit  
'Cause it's your life to live or to lose  
I'm tired of singing the death culture blues!  
  
Now we're told just to get in line  
And bowo down the almighty dollar sign  
Battle turns from left to right  
But I'm not going down without a fight  
  
I've done my time, I took my bath  
I'm back on track down the shining pathy  
'Cause it's your life to live or to lose  
I've tired of singing the death culture blues!

bitch. I can dance  
Muthafucka. I can daaannncccee.  
  
I'm on crack, Walkin alleyways downtown, people drop change so I'm checkin the
ground behind a  
Nightclub, I can hear the bump outside I hear em' laughin' and drinkin' and
dancin' getin' live and  
I'm lonely, graspin' on my 55 cent, I don't know where my meds went, they been
spent and I'm bent, I  
Don't remember yesterday at all, I'm barkin at the moon as I'm pissin' on the
wall, people grippin'  
New cars checkin' out a few bars, they see me comin' side step a few yards I'm
like a bad man, holdin'  
Out my crusty ass hands scouldin' an imaginary friend scary and I'm blackin'
out just about to lose  
All hope, I was peerin through the window of a nightclub scopin', and there
she was everything I  
Planned for on the spotlight on the dance floor gravitatin'  
  
[Chorus]  
She kept her rythum her feet to the floor she dipped down she did the twirl
and she shook it some  
More she's ruby. She made me happy I tried to refrain I walk off but then I
run right back I'm at it  
Again she's callin'  
  
I ran a few blocks away and broke a bottle, carjacked a mini-van and punched
full throttle right back  
To the spot then I waited to get her, but when she came out, she had a bitch-
boy wit' her no problem,  
Hit the pipe and follow em' home and my imaginary friend gone have to leave me
alone cause this really  
Goin' down I feel it pullin me home knowin I'm a wicked clown I gotta throw it
down, she pulled in her  
And her fuck ass strolled in, I hit the pipe again and jump out the stolen,
jumpin through back yards  
Clumsey and trippin', it don't matter where ya go there's a throat slingin',
and the way she danced  
Split flames burnin me alive out here quit playin games I'm on the side of her
house lookin in through  
The back den and there she was with him again dancin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I walk right in through the front door unlocked, no gun cocked, cinder block,
clown paint, I came  
Here to dance boogy, umph ahhh, and maybe tap a little nookie, I'm creepin
music bumpin in the back,  
I'm down the hallway hidin' behind the coat rack, and here come the punk bout
to get champaighned, I  
Take the rock and pop em' with the damn thang, hit em' in the back of the
head, he dropped the wine  
But I caught him in time I had to take his life with a steak knife, I washed
it off and put it back  
I'm keepin' the place nice I'm comin bitch you want an olive or somethin' I'm
fuckin' straight out the  
Streets but I'm down with some frontin' I want to tango, but instead I'm still
outside the club and it's  
All in my head.

Might see em round the city and won't even say wassup  
When n-ggas play tough, wont even smile in mirrors  
And we learn to f-ck hoes off trial and error  
Just a small time n-gga, big city hustle  
Glued to the tv, Jigga, Diddy, Russell  
These were our heroes, strictly for them zero's  
For that Robert Deniro, n-ggas reload on them kilo's  
Dodgin them people,  
Mad at myself cause I done seen some things that I'd rather not tell  
Shawty smole crack and her boyfriend too  
Sometimes he touch her daughter like them boyfriends do  
Pull up to the club where the boys went too  
See that yellow tape and the boys in blue  
A n-gga on a strecther and though I never met ya  
I'm thinking God Bless ya, they city try and get ya  
Man, don't let the city get ya  
F-ck the horoscopes, know the ropes lke a wrestler  
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue

I know you only do what's best for me  
But is it cool if we negotiate my destiny  
They always tellin' me it's temporary  
Than why it's feelling like a cemetary  
My dreams aint got no obituaries  
My city hurting and none of us were equiped here  
You heard me say I was ballin'  
I probably make tears  
I'm trying to get clear  
I'm tryna quit fear  
Who wrote the scripts here  
These kids live there whole life just killing time  
Running the race with no finish line  
They tryna noose us with they ropes  
But I'm tryna climb  
I think my foolish pride might become my suicide  
But I aint tryna go, no baby  
And through these lines and quotes you gotta find some hope  
Cause I aint dying  
My words gon' last forever,  
You can hold the treasure  
Look inside you can see a diamond in my mind  
I'm tired of seeing dope fiends, wiping they nose clean  
Is my neighbourhood just a smoke screen  
I think I'm in the [?] I see lo green  
Sons raised by bo queens but there's no kings

It seems like n-ggas either feel ya or they try and kill ya  
I face the sky and hope to God aint acting unfamiliar  
You play whatever cards he deal no matter how peculiar  
They tell me that it's God's will, I'm asking God will ya  
Iller a n-gga from artist pain, momma smoking cocaine as it rains out  
Am I to blame, try to stay sane so I came out-side  
Where they rock with them thangs out  
To clear my mind at the same time they blew that boys brains out  
But will it change, it's like n-ggas is free but our minds still in the chains  
Brothers killing eachother, the blood spill it's a shame  
Will it ever slow up  
A lot of n-ggas getting older but they never grow up  
And do they son's like they fathers did and never show up  
Don't even cry about it, just another episode of life  
Watch the season n-gga no re-runs  
The devil buying soul's n-gga no refunds  
Man, don't let the city get ya  
F-ck the horoscopes know the ropes like a wrestler  
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue  
Your face on the front of our shirts screaming we miss ya  
Another day, another song, a mother prays  
Another gone  
But still we play like aint nothing wrong  
Like aint nothing wrong  
Cause aint nothing wrong  
I'm not as fast, I'm not as tall  
But before I pass  
I gotta ball  
I gotta ball  
I gotta ball  
N-gga I gotta ball

A child keeps beating on a toy drum  
And the tablets dropped on your tongue

Sake in  
The help is just around the corner  
For us  
  
Oh my head  
Just won't stop achin'  
I'm sat here lickin' my ruins  
I'm shattered  
But I really doesn't matter  
'Cause my rescue is gonna be here soon

Moody Blues,Melancholy Man,/m/moody+blues/melancholy+man_20095896.html,"I'm a melancholy man, that's what I am,  
All the world surrounds me, and my feet are on the ground.  
I'm a very lonely man, doing what I can,  
All the world astounds me and I think I understand  
That we're going to keep growing, wait and see.  
  
When all the stars are falling down  
Into the sea and on the ground,  
And angry voices carry on the wind,  
A beam of light will fill your head  
And you'll remember what's been said  
By all the good men this world's ever known.  
Another man is what you'll see,  
Who looks like you and looks like me,  
And yet somehow he will not feel the same,  
His life caught up in misery, he doesn't think like you and me,  
'Cause he can't see what you and I can see.

Alabama,A Candle In The Window,/a/alabama/a+candle+in+the+window_20005143.html,"There's a road that I remember leading to a special place  
Where the door was always open to a smiling face  
There's a picture on the mantle of a boy that looks like me  
It's always the same, there's a stocking with my name  
  
And a candle in the window, a flame against the night  
There's a candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light  
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are  
Just a candle in the window  
  
Maybe it's just wishful thiking I can hear the sleigh bells ring  
Almost taste teh pie she's baking, it's Christmas Eve  
  
And there's a candle in the window, a flame against the night  
The candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light  
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are  
Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart  
  
Wherever the years may take me no matter how far I go  
There's going to be a candle burning, it's always nice to know  
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are  
Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart

Jackson Browne,Linda Paloma,/j/jackson+browne/linda+paloma_20068657.html,"At the moment the music began  
And you heard the guitar player starting to sing  
You were filled with the beauty that ran  
Through what you were imagining  
  
Dreaming of scenes from those songs of love  
I was the endless sky  
And you were my Mexican dove  
  
Now the music that played in your ears  
Grows a little bit fainter each day  
And you find yourself looking through tears  
At the love you feel slipping away  
  
Though it's not the kind  
Of love you might hope to find  
If tears could release the heart  
From the shadows preferred by the mind  
  
Like a wind that comes up in the night  
Caressing your face while you sleep  
Love will fill your eyes with the sight  
Of a world you can't hope to keep  
  
Dreaming on after that moment's gone  
The light in your lover's eyes  
Disappears with the light of the dawn  
  
But the morning brings  
Strength to your restless wings  
And some other lover sings  
To the sun's bright corona  
  
I know all about these things

In my heart, I know that you'll come through

Came the day you said you'd be my own

Do you think that I haven't been around?  
Boy I wasn't born yesterday, yesterday  
Coming home late at night, flowers on the doorstep  
Trying to make it right  
Boy you gotta be high's what I got to say  
I got to say, I've done all I can  
I've given you every chance to prove you are my man  
But now there's nothing left to lose  
  
I'm free, like the wind  
Independent once again  
Yeah, I'm gone, I gotta be moving on  
Free, watch me fly  
Lift your hands and wave bye bye  
'cause I'm gone  
I gotta be movin' on, movin' movin' movin' on  
Movin' movin' movin' on, movin' movin' movin' on  
  
I think i'll go do the mall, make a couple of calls  
Gonna hang with the girls  
Just to keep from crying on a shoulder  
Ain't gonna turn back  
Nothing you can say can change that feeling that you get  
When you know that it's finally, finally over  
I've made up my mind  
Even though it hurts to leave your love behind  
I've got nothing left to lose  
  
I'm free, like the wind  
Independent once again  
Yeah, I'm gone, I gotta be moving on  
Free, watch me fly  
Lift your hands and wave bye bye

I gotta be movin' on, movin' movin' movin' on  
Movin' movin' movin' on, movin' movin' movin' on  
  
I'm gone  
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do  
Even if your heart is trying to tell you to  
Stay a little bit longer, trell you to  
Try a little bit harder, baby I know  
I can't live another day, sleep another night  
Waiting for you to change into something I  
Wish you could have been  
It's not what I'm into now  
  
I've done all I can  
Given you every chance to prove  
You are my man  
But now there's nothing left to lose  
  
I'm free, like the wind  
Independent once again  
Yeah, I'm gone, I gotta be moving on  
Free, watch me fly  
Lift your hands and wave bye bye  
'cause I'm gone  
  
I gotta be moving on  
Free from your spell  
Taking care of me myself  
Yeah, I'm gone  
I gotta be moving on  
  
I'm free, like the wind  
Independent once again  
I'm gone, moving on  
Free, watch me fly  
Lift your hands and wave bye bye  
Moving on  
Free from your spell  
Taking care of me myself  
  
Moving on, I'm gone  
Free from your spell, independent

Don't let it catch up with you.  
You gotta fight it to stay alive,  
And if it gets you, man, you're through.  
  
It smells so rotten and rank.  
Well, everybody calls it the squank.  
  
It's sick, depressing, getting bigger all the time.  
Don't help it any way you can.  
It's grey and brown and sometimes lime  
And it's spreading all over the land.  
  
And soon we'll be all breathing out of tanks  
If something ain't done about the squank.  
  
The meanest thing the world's ever bred  
By me and you and my kin fold too.  
A monster can't live unless it's fed,  
And it's being fed by me and you.  
And soon it's gonna leave the world blank,  
And we'll all be erased by the squank.

You stress me out and that's the truth  
I don't want no substitute  
For the peace of my mind that comes to me  
Cause I'm living drama free  
Can you give me one bit of rest?  
Gotta say you didn't pass the test  
I thought about it but you aint Gods best  
Youre just not what I need  
Tried to run a stupid game on me  
I'm not blind I see quite clearly  
Can't have you disrespecting me  
So I'm gone just like the breeze  
Can you give me just one bit of space?  
Girl I love you but you're driving me insane  
Gossiping always into trouble and then  
You want me to justify  
Tired of hearing stories, he said, she said  
Tired of hearing bout the crazy things you did  
Would you listen to me just once or twice?  
Make a difference in your life  
But you don't now  
Bridge:  
I've made changes I know you see  
No more old this is my new leaf  
Leaving behind all that's stressing me  
Needlessly, drama free

(Oh oh oh) Can you feel me?  
Its not that I don't care about it  
Its just that I've got to do without it

Foreigner,Double Vision,/f/foreigner/double+vision_20054887.html,"Feeling down n' dirty, feeling kinda mean  
I've been from one to another extreme  
This time I had a good time, ain't got time to wait  
I want to stick around till I can't see straight  
  
Fill my eyes with that double vision, no disguise for that double vision  
Ooh, when it gets through to me, it's always new to me  
My double vision gets the best of me  
  
Never do more than I really need  
My mind is racing, but my body's in the lead  
Tonight's the night, I'm gonna push it to the limit  
I live all of my years in a single minute  
  
Fill my eyes with that double vision, no disguise for that double vision  
Ooh, when it gets through to me, it's always new to me  
My double vision always seems to get the best of me, the best of me, yeah  
  
Ooh, double vision, I need my double vision  
It takes me out of my head, takin' me out of my head  
I get my double vision, oh, seeing double double  
Oh, I have double vision, yeah, I'm getting double vision

To go to America across the sea

They got all his post cards  
But his body has never been found  
To this day  
To this day  
She got a job as a domestic  
Workin' for the minimum wage  
All her friends back home in Jamaica  
They say, 'You really got it made in the shade'  
But they don't see her sweat and grind  
And her bended on her knees  
She wishes she was back in Jamaica  
Beneath the coconut trees

Everyday, Everyday

She found what it was all about  
Oh no, she doesn't regret it  
She's just glad that she got out  
But others aren't so lucky  
They're there till the day they die  
Trapped in steel and concrete  
No beach No moon No sky

My age has never made me wise  
But I keep pushing on and on and on and on

Collapsing as it sees the pain  
If I could only shut it out  
I've come too far  
To see the end now  
Even if my way is wrong  
I keep pushing on and on and on and on

Megadeth,Ashes In Your Mouth,/m/megadeth/ashes+in+your+mouth_20091356.html,"People have round shoulders from fairing heavy loads  
And the soldiers liberate them, laying mines along their roads  
Sorrow paid for valor is too much to recall  
Of the countless corpses piled up along the wailing wall  
  
Melting down all metals, turning plows and shears to swords  
Shun words of the Bible, we need implements of war  
Chalklines and red puddles of those who have been slain  
Destiny, that crooked schemer, says the dead shall rise again  
  
Where do we go from here?  
And should we really care?  
The end is finally here  
God have mercy!  
  
Now we've rewritten history  
The one thing we've found out  
Sweet taste of vindication  
It turns to ashes in your mouth  
  
Where do we go from here?  
And should we really care?  
The end is finally here  
God have mercy!  
  
If you're fighting to live  
It's okay to die  
The answer to your question is  
Welcome to tomorrow  
  
Where do we go from here?  
God have mercy!

How sweet is her warm embrace  
Safe in the scent of jasmine  
So safe in her gold and lace  
  
Mornings I find, she's left me  
So cold so alone, but aware  
I try to escape, she finds me  
Oh run though I may, she's there, there, there, there, there  
  
Luck is a lady whose smile is as cold as a stone  
She'll bring you things, many things you might never have known  
But when your die is cast she'll have the final laugh at you  
She'll lock you in a duel, where you come out the fool  
  
Beware of the Queen of Spades  
Her black widow's curse might find you yet  
Beware of a love that you will regret  
Her love means only your death  
  
Day into night she's with me  
Turn of a card, she's there  
The first time is free, you know  
But from now on, pay me, me, me, me, me  
  
Beware of the Queen of Spades  
Her black widow's curse might find you yet  
Beware of a love that you will regret  
Her love means only your death

Lies  
I told them that we were doing fine, very much to their  
Surprise  
For how were they to know that here the ground was soaked  
In red  
Or that we could fill the valley with our dead.  
I started out and told them that by Christmas we'd begin  
To pack our bags and head on home to bring the new year  
In  
While all around me boys who help me sow last season's  
Crop  
By charging at the cannons till they drop  
  
I told my mother not to write cause we're always moving  
  
On  
I told my brother not to join cause he'd only fight me  
Gun  
But if we keep on much further retreating all the way  
Oh we'd all be going home just any day.

I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb  
I was soft inside  
There was something going on  
You do something to me that I can't explain  
Hold me closer and I feel no pain  
Every beat of my heart  
We got something going on  
Tender love is blind  
It requires a dedication  
All this love we feel needs no conversation  
We can ride it together, ah ha  
Making love with each other, ah ha  
  
Islands in the stream  
That is what we are  
No one in between  
How can we be wrong  
Sail away with me  
To another world  
And we rely on each other, ah ha  
From one lover to another, ah ha  
  
I can't live without you if the love was gone  
Everything is nothing when you got no one  
And you walk in the night  
Slowly losing sight of the real thing  
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt  
Too deep in love and we got no way out  
And the message is clear  
This could be the year for the real thing  
No more will you cry  
Baby I will hurt you never  
We start and end as one  
In love forever  
We can ride it together, ah ha  
Making love with each other, ah ha  
  
Islands in the stream  
That is what we are  
No one in between  
How can we be wrong  
Sail away with me
