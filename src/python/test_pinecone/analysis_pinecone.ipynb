I'd love to go back to when we played as kids But things changed, and that's the way it is Noah Odige People walking by But they ain't looking in my eye Cuz as a brother in America I’m just destined to die The court date is set With a jury for the trial Got a public defender Who didn't even open the case file But that's how it is in the system Poverty always fall, victim Tryna get some money in a way that's sad It's just breaking bad How we make that cash But that's not a reason for me to get discouraged I wanna go back to when our black brothers flourished But everyone out here we need them to see That we still held captive cuz freedom ain't free But that's how its post to be How can the law get a brother if he close to me But the men that speak those same words Is a brother that die before he can get heard Now if I speak to the world that helped me make this The sexist, misogynist, and the racist I just speak cause we all want the hate to stop All the violence just heard the latest pop Talent That's just the way it is Things will never be the same That's just the way it is Aww yeah Noah Odige Cu u know racism and discrimination Is not just an issue of this generation But more than hundred years in the making It's all there ain't no faking When we thought we made progress It progress faster faster Living like slaves With hate our master But see racism ain't a one-way street Blacks can hate While whites take heat No matter the color the blood the same We all God’s children No matter what the claim And we ain't enemies We all friends That's how we make this country great again And that's real talk to the hater's minds We act like this all new ain't the latest finds But the latest news is bout gun abuse And how any day now another bomb blew a fuse But see all this is one-sided We stand with love Not hate divided And if you stand with me Better come with me Cuz That's the Way It Is Talent That's just the way it is Things will never be the same That's just the way it is Aww yeah That's just the way it is Things will never be the same That's just the way it is Aww yeah Noah Odige Look every single day ain't a game WE live in a world that love and kill the same Where Tomorrow ain't guaranteed or promised Our new moniker is boy you don't want this Gotta heater in our pockets But when charge comes They won't ever drop it Cuz we our own pilots in the cockpit We make our own bed and the beds we gon rock it And reap what we sow And this heap we all know Of our brothers in love Front seat to the gun show Try to fight back Is a loss and a dunzo And no matter where we fly People always tryna hunt us and we die And we try to fight back with our words and pride With our grief our fuel and our pain our guide But see that's how it is right now Everyone stand up just to fall down And we act Like all this will go away But we gotta make a change man starting today And see we about more than just color We a world filled with sisters and brothers And we gotta look up and look to each other We gotta fill with love and the hate we gon cover And we anyone say otherwise You don't gotta heed a word from them other guys Cuz the harder you hate the harder you fall We gotta let love in not build a wall 2Pac It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live And let's change the way we treat each other You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do What we gotta do, to survive\",\n",

Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
