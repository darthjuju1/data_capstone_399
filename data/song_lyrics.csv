Let's take our time tonight, girl

There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside

There go my regards, but regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless

[Intro: Rihanna & Jay Z]
Lo siento viniendo en el aire (Sí)
Escucho los gritos en todos lados (Sí)
Soy adicta a la emoción (Estoy listo)
Es un amorío peligroso (¿Qué pasa? Vamos)
No puedo asustarme cuando eso viene bajo
Tienes un problema, dímelo ahora (¿Qué pasa?)
La única cosa que está en mi mente (¿Qué pasa?)
Es quién va a dirigir esta ciudad esta noche (Ah, ¿Qué pasa?)
Es quién va a dirigir esta ciudad esta noche (Sí, ¿Qué pasa? Sí)
Nosotros vamos a dirigir esta ciudad

[Verso 1: Jay Z]
Lo hacemos, sí, yo dije: lo hacemos
Este es Roc Nation, jura tu fidelidad
Ten tu uniforme puesto, de negro todo
Tarjetas negras, autos nеgros, de negro todo
Y nuestras chicas son pájaros nеgros yendo con los Dillinger
Profundizo más si estos chicos son lo suficientemente reales
Este es la Familia, te lo explicaré luego
Pero por ahora, déjame volver a este papel
Tengo un par de billetes guardados y estoy tratando de volver
Le di un apretón a Doug y perdí un flip por cinco pilas
Sí, estoy hablando de 5 comas, 6 ceros, punto cero, aquí Doug
De vuelta a correr en círculos alrededor de los negros, ahora nos cuadramos
Espera

[Estribillo: Rihanna & Jay Z]
La vida es un juego, pero no es justo (Sí)
Rompo las reglas, así que no me importa (Uh-huh)
Así que sigo haciendo mi propia cosa
Caminando alto contra la lluvia (¿Qué pasa?)
La victoria está dentro de la milla
Casi allí, no te rindas ahora (¿Qué pasa?)
La única cosa que está en mi mente (¿Qué pasa?)
Es quién va a dirigir esta ciudad esta noche (Uh, sí)
Ey, ey, ey, ey (¿Qué pasa?)
¿Quién va a dirigir esta ciudad esta noche?

[Verso 2: Jay Z]
Lo hacemos, sí, yo dije: lo hacemos
Tú puedes llamarme Caesar, en un Caesar negro
Por favor sigue al líder, asi que, Eric B, lo hacemos
Microfono cruel, este es el regreso del dios
Paz, Dios, ah, ah, no hay nadie más fresco
Estoy en Maison, ah, Martin Margiela
En la mesa, gritando, ""Al carajo el otro lado! Ellos andan celosos!""
Tenemos un banquete lleno de chicas, ellas tienen una mesa llena de muchachos
Sí, y no están gastando en ningún pastel
Ellos deberían tirar sus manos allí porque ellos no tienen ninguna pica
Sí, todo mi equipo tiene dinero
Así que mi banquete se parece a ""Millionaires' Row""

[Verso 3: Kanye West, Jay-Z]
Está loco como tú puedes ir de ser Joe Blow
A que todos estén en tu pene; no homo
Le compré a mi familia entera carros; no Volvos
La próxima vez estoy en la Iglesia: por favor, sin fotos
Escoltas policiales, pasaportes de todos
Esta es la vida que todos piden
Esta es la vida rápida, estamos en un curso acelerado
¿Para qué crees que rapeo, para promocionar un jodido Rav 4?
Pero sé que si me quedo atrofiado
Todas estas chicas solo van a querer una cosa
Puedo pasar toda mi vida de Good Will Hunting
Lo único bueno que viene es tan bueno cuando me ando viniendo
Ella tiene un culo que se tragará una tanga
Y por arriba, ungh, dos picaduras de abeja
Y estoy bebiendo el Riesling
Y mi negro acaba de salir de la comisaría
Nos importa un carajo el drama que tu amigo trae
Solo estoy tratando de cambiar el color de tu anillo de estado de ánimo
Reebok, nena, necesitas probar algunas cosas nuevas
¿Alguna vez has tenido zapatos sin cordones?
""¿Qué es eso, Ye?"" ""Nena, estos son tacones""
""Es eso un May— ¡¿Qué?!"" ""Nena estas son ruedas""
Te equivocas cuando no estás bebiendo, toma una recarga
Te sientes como si estuvieras corriendo, ¿huh? Ahora ya sabes cómo nos sentimos (¿Qué pasa?)

Same Love,Macklemore,"pop rap,seattle hip hop,neo mellow",2012-10-09,"[Piano Intro]
[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
And ""gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it
[Trombone Interlude]
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause, progress, march on
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
When kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up, sing
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

I'm only thinking of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes

[Verse 2]
The channel, a professional liar
How I long to contradict those vibes
Joni help me, I think I'm falling
It's not the love and I quest the why
I don't know, If I'm right, I'm right
But if I'm wrong then show me I'm wrong
The fear of pity is always awake
But infinite sympathy's completely gone
It's the windows, the doors
The passageways to the truth
Oh my God, it echoes the mind
In total recall as wild as the deuce
And so deceiving is the clouded heart
So superficial is the open wound
I caress the infinite light
That even at night overshadows the moon that sings to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, define my love, that lives within you
Even when I die, it will sing to you
You can only tell if remorse has done you well
The misconstrued my answers due to the lack of love, reason

[Chorus 2]
Whatever it is I do
I try to think about you
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie
Whatever it is I do
I'm only thinkin' of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes

Is it so hard to satisfy your senses?
You found out to love me you have to climb some fences
Scratching and crawling along the floor to touch you
And just when it feels right
You say you found someone to hold you

Baby, tell me, does she love you like the way I love you?
Does she stimulate you, attract and captivate you?
Tell me, does she miss you, existing just to kiss you

Tell me, does she want you, infatuate and haunt you?
Does she know just how to shock you, electrify and rock you?
Does she inject you, seduce you and affect you

Can I survive all the implications?
Even if I tried, could you be less than an addiction?

And fight, kill and die

Hold you like I do?

Meets her best mate at the shop, buy some cheap wine

Capacity to give him all he needs

Changes (remake) ft. 2Pac & Talent,Noah OD,"g funk,gangster rap,hip hop,rap,west coast rap",1998-01-01,"2Pac

I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things changed, and that's the way it is

Noah Odige

People walking by
But they ain't looking in my eye
Cuz as a brother in America
I’m just destined to die
The court date is set
With a jury for the trial
Got a public defender
Who didn't even open the case file
But that's how it is in the system
Poverty always fall, victim
Tryna get some money in a way that's sad
It's just breaking bad
How we make that cash
But that's not a reason for me to get discouraged
I wanna go back to when our black brothers flourished
But everyone out here we need them to see
That we still held captive cuz freedom ain't free
But that's how its post to be
How can the law get a brother if he close to me
But the men that speak those same words
Is a brother that die before he can get heard
Now if I speak to the world that helped me make this
The sexist, misogynist, and the racist
I just speak cause we all want the hate to stop
All the violence just heard the latest pop

Talent

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

Noah Odige

Cu u know racism and discrimination
Is not just an issue of this generation
But more than hundred years in the making
It's all there ain't no faking
When we thought we made progress
It progress faster faster
Living like slaves
With hate our master
But see racism ain't a one-way street
Blacks can hate
While whites take heat
No matter the color the blood the same
We all God’s children
No matter what the claim
And we ain't enemies
We all friends
That's how we make this country great again
And that's real talk to the hater's minds
We act like this all new ain't the latest finds
But the latest news is bout gun abuse
And how any day now another bomb blew a fuse
But see all this is one-sided
We stand with love
Not hate divided
And if you stand with me
Better come with me Cuz
That's the Way It Is

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same

Look every single day ain't a game
WE live in a world that love and kill the same
Where Tomorrow ain't guaranteed or promised
Our new moniker is boy you don't want this
Gotta heater in our pockets
But when charge comes
They won't ever drop it
Cuz we our own pilots in the cockpit
We make our own bed and the beds we gon rock it
And reap what we sow
And this heap we all know
Of our brothers in love
Front seat to the gun show
Try to fight back
Is a loss and a dunzo
And no matter where we fly
People always tryna hunt us and we die
And we try to fight back with our words and pride
With our grief our fuel and our pain our guide
But see that's how it is right now
Everyone stand up just to fall down
And we act Like all this will go away
But we gotta make a change man starting today
And see we about more than just color
We a world filled with sisters and brothers
And we gotta look up and look to each other
We gotta fill with love and the hate we gon cover
And we anyone say otherwise
You don't gotta heed a word from them other guys
Cuz the harder you hate the harder you fall
We gotta let love in not build a wall

Before she caught my eye

When angel passed close by

To see her in that négligée is really just too much

An ugly woman cooks meals on time

Never make a pretty woman your wife

Don't let your friends say you have no taste
Go ahead and marry anyway

Take it from me, she's a better catch

They say boys don't cry
But your dad has shed a lot of tears
They say I should be a strong man
But baby, I'm still filled with fear
Sometimes I don't know who I am
Sometimes I question why I'm here
I just wanna be a good dad
Will I be? I have no idea
They say girls shouldn't be tough
And moms should raise their kids at home
But baby, I know that that isn't true
Cause your momma's the toughest person I know
I wanna raise you to be like her
And watch you show the world how to do it on your own
I'm still tryna figure out who I am
I don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong
I'm gonna be there for your first breath
I don't know if I'll be there for your first step
I can promise you that I'll try to work less
But the tour's routed, and I got this album
Put in so many hours, and I just want the outcome
To be something that I can look back and I can be proud of
Don't wanna be a dad that's living in FaceTime
But I got a world to sing to and you at the same time
I won't spoil you, you can trust that
For your sweet sixteen, you get a bus pass
Had your heart broken? Been there, done that
I love you and I can't give you enough of that
Give back to community that raised you up

Listen to Sam Cooke, a change gon' come

Do that for the rest of your life
And eventually, the world will change

I recommend that you read ""The Alchemist""
Listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus
Tell the truth, regardless of the consequence

Take your girl to the prom

Slow dance with your woman in your arms
Sneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe
Don't wake your mom up
Do yoga, learn 'bout karma
Find God, but leave the dogma
The quickest way to happiness? Learning to be selfless
Ask more questions, talk about yourself less
Study David Bowie, James Baldwin and 2Pac
Watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop
Wear a helmet, don't be stupid
Jaywalk, but look before you do it
If it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help
Get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends, 'til it melts

At the mexican discotheque
She gives him french kisses

Just digging the music from those sweet soul bands

She keeps him outta fights
Holds on to his hand

Under the table her bag is busting at the seams
She made sure to bring everything

Just by montague street
His friend eddie he did the respray
So he couldn't drive it all last week
And it cost most of the money that he had saved up
To pay eddie's receipt
But he figures it's worth it 'cos the disguise is a must
When they go missing they're gonna look for the van first

And my monthy check came in just right

Wonders at his powers of staying awake

Felt so real, and so true
Looking back on a year we spent together
How it's been, what we went through
Although we've had our little ups and downs
We've still pulled through

Baby girl, you're my world, my everything
I wanna lace you with diamonds and every ring
Give you everything you dream and fantasize
'Cause you can tell me that you love me looking in my eyes
You keep it real with me

Keep doing what you do

You make me believe I have nothing to lose

Deep down I always knew
That you would be mine

Do you believe in destiny
Because I got a funny feeling
This was meant to be
Without you I'd be lost
I need you next to me
Preferably in the house full of luxuries and little kids
From day one I was sprung
Knew you was gonna be one
'Cause my heart spoke for the very first time in a long while
And every time you smile
I can see us walking up the aisle
With you carrying my child

Makes my soul go weak
The only one who makes my heart wanna beat
And I, I could never live without you
You know that what I feel has to be true
'Cause you're my, my sweet love

Ever since the first time that I looked into your eyes
I knew that you were gonna be mine
Feeling you from the inside
When you're not by my side
You're the only girl that's on my mind

Nothin' she ever wore was ever common
Her dates, heads of state, men of taste
Lawyers, doctors, no one was too great for her to get with
Or even mess with, the Prez she says was next on her list
And believe me, you, it's as good as true
There ain't a man alive that she couldn't get next to
She had it all in the bag so she should have been glad
But she was mad and sad and feelin' bad
Thinkin' about the things that she never had

Because he seen a teen in tight jeans
What makes him react like that is biological
But scheme of gettin' in those jeans, is diabolical
But of course he does it, and she gives him rap
And before you even know it, they jump in the sack
As a matter of fact, sometimes it’s like that
But anyway, ready or not, here he cums
And like a dumb son-of-a-gun, oops, he forgot the condoms

What It Feels Like for a Girl,Madonna,"dance pop,pop",2000-09-19,"[Spoken Sample: Charlotte Gainsbourg]
Girls can wear jeans
And cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots
Because it's okay to be a boy
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading
But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you?
What it feels like for a girl

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Silky smooth
Lips as sweet as candy, baby
Tight blue jeans
Skin that shows in patches

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently, baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips, repenting

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best
Could you be a little less?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world

She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Starving, you know, covergirls eat nothin'
She says, ""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything, what's a little bit of hunger?
I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurtin', let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight

He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home, he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me every time I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on cloud nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

[Verse 3: Spinderella]
Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Mine'll rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mack ****
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like 7-Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me 'cause good men are hard to find

[Verse 4: Salt]
My man gives real loving, that's why I call him killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker, 'cause that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cause his mama taught him that (I've got a good man)

Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly

The world I used to know

[Verse 1]
Some day some old familiar rain will come along and know my name
And then my shelter will be gone, and I'll have to move along
But ’till I do, I'll stay awhile and track the hidden country of your smile

[Verse 2]
Some day the man I used to be will come along and call on me
And then because I'm just a man, you’ll find my feet are made of sand
But 'till that time I'll tell you lies and chart the hidden boundaries of your eyes

[Verse 3]
Some day the world I use to know will come along and bid me go
Then I'll be leaving you behind for love is just a state of mind
But 'till that day I'll be your man and love away your troubles if I can
And 'till that day I'll be your man and love away your troubles if I can",doo-wop,2011-09-30,7,False

It's every little thing from her head down to her feet

And every word she means
Like it could be about me (it could be about me)

At one of those shows they do for the radio
And when she looked at me

We never went to sleep

I've got to admit, this feeling's legit
I don't want to stop and she don't want me to quit
But she gets a little nervous with what we do
Scared what they would say
What they would talk about if they knew

Heard her sing a song and I knew that she would write about it
Saw her in a magazine, I knew that she could keep it quiet
Keep it in the sheets, the radio the beats
Between you and me, we'll throw away the key

And lovers war with arrows over

I have no snare in my headphones
There you go

Yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
'Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
Well, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be!

Had it up to here with the jargon, pardon they're my rules I started

Tell me why they playing with the fire and the kerosene?

To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise
You'll catch the fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me runnin'
Through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathin'

Можешь выбрать любую позу, какую захочешь
Ты можешь сделать всё сама, а можешь и просто расслабиться
Температура повышается, окей, переходим на следующий уровень
На танцполе полно народу, прям не протолкнуться
Но ради тебя, детка, я остановлю всю движуху
Если ты будешь нимфоманкой, то и я стану нимфоманом
В отеле или на заднем сиденье тачки, что возьмём напрокат
На пляже или в парке — в любом месте, какое ты выберешь
У меня есть волшебная палочка. Я доктор, и я выписываю вам дозу любви
Твои друзья дразнят тебя, ведь ты влюбилась в меня по уши
Хочешь показать мне, как умеешь двигаться, детка? Нет проблем
Забирайся ко мне и работай бёдрами, прыгай вверх-вниз, как лоурайдер
Когда становится жарко, я словно среди сучек, что текут по весне
Заставлю тебя работать, пока не вспотеешь, и только тогда дам поиграться с волшебной палочкой

Я растаю не в твоих руках, а только у тебя во рту (Ха-ха)

Отдайся мне, детка, мы сделаем всё медленно и аккуратно
Забирайся наверх и представь, что ты попала на родео
Кажется, ты никогда не слышала подобных звуков
Всё потому, что я никогда не испытывал ничего подобного
И каждый раз, как только я вхожу в дверь
Она тянется к моей ширинке, чтобы её расстегнуть
Мы словно на каких-то гонках — кто разденется быстрее
Чёрт, в стрингах она выглядит так эротично, что даже как-то иронично
То, что я вижу её задницу перед собой, даже когда уйду домой
Я дотрагиваюсь до правильного места в правильное время
Хоть включён свет, хоть выключен, она всегда любит, когда я сзади
Это так привлекательно, вы бы видели, как она двигается
Своими бёдрами, когда мы делаем это на полу
И пока она не остановится, не остановлюсь и я
Вспотели насквозь, но мы не прекращаем это делать
Одновременно с этим пьём шампанское, бутылка за бутылкой
И мы не остановимся, пока не выпьем всё до последней капли

Figuring which club to sneak in
Fancy drinks and fifty-dollar cover charge
Lately it's been a big hassle
Heineken and New Castle
To make sure he's fitting in and living large
Disregard the lies that he will tell
And what he's probably like 'cause
It's not hard his charm is gonna
Get him through the night
If he wants to rock he rocks
If he wants to roll he rolls
He can roll with the punches
Long as he feels like he's in control
If he wants to stay he stays
If he wants to go he goes
He doesn't care how he gets there
Long as he gets somewhere he knows oh no

Ah na na na na na na na na na na na

See her heavy make up and cut t-shirt
Every girl out wants to be her
But they look the same already why adjust
Reading the magazine secrets
Forgetting the topical regrets
'Cause If she comes home all alone the night's a bust
It's a must the swivel in her hips
And the look she gives
It's all her trust if only in the morning
She knew where she lived

'Cause if she wants to rock she rocks
If she wants to roll she rolls
She can roll with the punches

From drink to drink and at the bar with cash to blow
Shot to shot it's getting hot
Advance the plot to see how far it's gonna go
All depends so ditch the friends and grab a cab
Another chance at cheap romance
Doesn't count 'cause the room is spinning
Nothing to lose tonight they both are winning
And they fall in love as they fall in bed
They sing

If they wanna rock they rock
If they wanna roll they roll
They can roll with the punches

From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater's ribcage!
And let it be known that from this day forward, I wanna just say
Thanks, 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise, 'cause I came with 5'9"", but I feel like I'm 6'8""

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9""]
By the time you hear this, I'll prolly already be outtie
I advance like goin' from totin' iron to goin' and buyin'
Four or five of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me: ""Slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it!""
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him
The same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is, or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
'Cause what goes up must come down
You goin' down on somethin' you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oww, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and auto-tunes
'Cause now I'm in the Aston; I went from havin'
My city locked up to gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches
On the radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams starin' at a beehive
And how real is that? I remember signin' my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag

[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight, we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine, 'cause—

Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless

Silver Moon,Michael Nesmith,country rock,2010-03-01,"[Verse 1]
See the lazy windmill slowly turning
Cutting up the marble canyons of the sky
See the dust around my feet go churning
Moving with the winds down the highways of goodbye

Looking over maps of memories for the road
Standing in the lonely light of the silver moon
With the unexpected destination of my home

As that same old wave of loneliness returns
And I can see you when I close my eyes
Speaking very softly as you turn

Lo siento viniendo en el aire (Sí)
Escucho los gritos en todos lados (Sí)
Soy adicta a la emoción (Estoy listo)
Es un amorío peligroso (¿Qué pasa? Vamos)
No puedo asustarme cuando eso viene bajo
Tienes un problema, dímelo ahora (¿Qué pasa?)
La única cosa que está en mi mente (¿Qué pasa?)
Es quién va a dirigir esta ciudad esta noche (Ah, ¿Qué pasa?)
Es quién va a dirigir esta ciudad esta noche (Sí, ¿Qué pasa? Sí)
Nosotros vamos a dirigir esta ciudad

[Verso 1: Jay Z]
Lo hacemos, sí, yo dije: lo hacemos
Este es Roc Nation, jura tu fidelidad
Ten tu uniforme puesto, de negro todo
Tarjetas negras, autos nеgros, de negro todo
Y nuestras chicas son pájaros nеgros yendo con los Dillinger
Profundizo más si estos chicos son lo suficientemente reales
Este es la Familia, te lo explicaré luego
Pero por ahora, déjame volver a este papel
Tengo un par de billetes guardados y estoy tratando de volver
Le di un apretón a Doug y perdí un flip por cinco pilas
Sí, estoy hablando de 5 comas, 6 ceros, punto cero, aquí Doug
De vuelta a correr en círculos alrededor de los negros, ahora nos cuadramos
Espera

[Estribillo: Rihanna & Jay Z]
La vida es un juego, pero no es justo (Sí)
Rompo las reglas, así que no me importa (Uh-huh)
Así que sigo haciendo mi propia cosa
Caminando alto contra la lluvia (¿Qué pasa?)
La victoria está dentro de la milla
Casi allí, no te rindas ahora (¿Qué pasa?)
La única cosa que está en mi mente (¿Qué pasa?)
Es quién va a dirigir esta ciudad esta noche (Uh, sí)
Ey, ey, ey, ey (¿Qué pasa?)
¿Quién va a dirigir esta ciudad esta noche?

[Verso 2: Jay Z]
Lo hacemos, sí, yo dije: lo hacemos
Tú puedes llamarme Caesar, en un Caesar negro
Por favor sigue al líder, asi que, Eric B, lo hacemos
Microfono cruel, este es el regreso del dios
Paz, Dios, ah, ah, no hay nadie más fresco
Estoy en Maison, ah, Martin Margiela
En la mesa, gritando, ""Al carajo el otro lado! Ellos andan celosos!""
Tenemos un banquete lleno de chicas, ellas tienen una mesa llena de muchachos
Sí, y no están gastando en ningún pastel
Ellos deberían tirar sus manos allí porque ellos no tienen ninguna pica
Sí, todo mi equipo tiene dinero
Así que mi banquete se parece a ""Millionaires' Row""

La vida es un juego, pero no es justo

Está loco como tú puedes ir de ser Joe Blow
A que todos estén en tu pene; no homo
Le compré a mi familia entera carros; no Volvos
La próxima vez estoy en la Iglesia: por favor, sin fotos
Escoltas policiales, pasaportes de todos
Esta es la vida que todos piden
Esta es la vida rápida, estamos en un curso acelerado
¿Para qué crees que rapeo, para promocionar un jodido Rav 4?
Pero sé que si me quedo atrofiado
Todas estas chicas solo van a querer una cosa
Puedo pasar toda mi vida de Good Will Hunting
Lo único bueno que viene es tan bueno cuando me ando viniendo
Ella tiene un culo que se tragará una tanga
Y por arriba, ungh, dos picaduras de abeja
Y estoy bebiendo el Riesling
Y mi negro acaba de salir de la comisaría
Nos importa un carajo el drama que tu amigo trae
Solo estoy tratando de cambiar el color de tu anillo de estado de ánimo
Reebok, nena, necesitas probar algunas cosas nuevas
¿Alguna vez has tenido zapatos sin cordones?
""¿Qué es eso, Ye?"" ""Nena, estos son tacones""
""Es eso un May— ¡¿Qué?!"" ""Nena estas son ruedas""

Same Love,Macklemore,"pop rap,seattle hip hop,neo mellow",2012-10-09,"[Piano Intro]
[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
And ""gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it
[Trombone Interlude]
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause, progress, march on
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
When kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up, sing
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love

The shadow of a lover goes dancing by
Looking for a little bit of love to grow, so
Give me love, give me heart and soul
You never let me cross to the other side now
I'm tied to the hope that you will somehow
Hard on the heels of something more
But I lost your love, heart and soul
The tear in my heart as you walk on by (More than an ocean)
I feel so low and your head is high
Everything you do convinces me more (Keeps us apart)
Please give me love, give me heart and soul
Looking to the day when I saw your face (I feel a tearing)

Left me for another, I turned to stone

Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read

I turned my back on love, but baby I was wrong
Do I miss your touch, do I tell myself a lie
Can't get enough, when I'm lying by your side
And in the middle of the night I cry . 

Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
I got a burning heart
Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me

Shadows moving on the wall
Slowly we begin to fall
Lying in a pool of sweat
Another night I can't forget

Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
I got a burning heart

Meets her best mate at the shop, buy some cheap wine

Absent on absinthe, dancing to bad synths

Just you getting lit in the queue to the dance floor

(Wa-ooh) Seems he was troubled by just one thing
(Wah-wa-ooh) He opened the lid and shook his fist, and said
(Wa-ooh) ""Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?""

Reminds him of his little lady
Capacity to give him all he needs

Changes (remake) ft. 2Pac & Talent,Noah OD,"g funk,gangster rap,hip hop,rap,west coast rap",1998-01-01,"2Pac

I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things changed, and that's the way it is

Noah Odige

People walking by
But they ain't looking in my eye
Cuz as a brother in America
I’m just destined to die
The court date is set
With a jury for the trial
Got a public defender
Who didn't even open the case file
But that's how it is in the system
Poverty always fall, victim
Tryna get some money in a way that's sad
It's just breaking bad
How we make that cash
But that's not a reason for me to get discouraged
I wanna go back to when our black brothers flourished
But everyone out here we need them to see
That we still held captive cuz freedom ain't free
But that's how its post to be
How can the law get a brother if he close to me
But the men that speak those same words
Is a brother that die before he can get heard
Now if I speak to the world that helped me make this
The sexist, misogynist, and the racist
I just speak cause we all want the hate to stop
All the violence just heard the latest pop

Talent

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

Noah Odige

Cu u know racism and discrimination
Is not just an issue of this generation
But more than hundred years in the making
It's all there ain't no faking
When we thought we made progress
It progress faster faster
Living like slaves
With hate our master
But see racism ain't a one-way street
Blacks can hate
While whites take heat
No matter the color the blood the same
We all God’s children
No matter what the claim
And we ain't enemies
We all friends
That's how we make this country great again
And that's real talk to the hater's minds
We act like this all new ain't the latest finds
But the latest news is bout gun abuse
And how any day now another bomb blew a fuse
But see all this is one-sided
We stand with love
Not hate divided
And if you stand with me
Better come with me Cuz
That's the Way It Is

Talent

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same

Noah Odige

Look every single day ain't a game
WE live in a world that love and kill the same
Where Tomorrow ain't guaranteed or promised
Our new moniker is boy you don't want this
Gotta heater in our pockets
But when charge comes
They won't ever drop it
Cuz we our own pilots in the cockpit
We make our own bed and the beds we gon rock it
And reap what we sow
And this heap we all know
Of our brothers in love
Front seat to the gun show
Try to fight back
Is a loss and a dunzo
And no matter where we fly
People always tryna hunt us and we die
And we try to fight back with our words and pride
With our grief our fuel and our pain our guide
But see that's how it is right now
Everyone stand up just to fall down
And we act Like all this will go away
But we gotta make a change man starting today
And see we about more than just color
We a world filled with sisters and brothers
And we gotta look up and look to each other
We gotta fill with love and the hate we gon cover
And we anyone say otherwise
You don't gotta heed a word from them other guys
Cuz the harder you hate the harder you fall
We gotta let love in not build a wall

You want his love much more than mine

They say boys don't cry
But your dad has shed a lot of tears
They say I should be a strong man
But baby, I'm still filled with fear
Sometimes I don't know who I am
Sometimes I question why I'm here
I just wanna be a good dad
Will I be? I have no idea
They say girls shouldn't be tough
And moms should raise their kids at home
But baby, I know that that isn't true
Cause your momma's the toughest person I know
I wanna raise you to be like her
And watch you show the world how to do it on your own
I'm still tryna figure out who I am
I don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong
I'm gonna be there for your first breath
I don't know if I'll be there for your first step
I can promise you that I'll try to work less
But the tour's routed, and I got this album
Put in so many hours, and I just want the outcome
To be something that I can look back and I can be proud of
Don't wanna be a dad that's living in FaceTime
But I got a world to sing to and you at the same time
I won't spoil you, you can trust that
For your sweet sixteen, you get a bus pass
Had your heart broken? Been there, done that
I love you and I can't give you enough of that
Give back to community that raised you up
Read Langston Hughes, I suggest ""A Raisin in the Sun""
Listen to Sam Cooke, a change gon' come
You put the work in, don't worry about the praise, my love
Don't try to change the world, find something that you love
And do it every day
Do that for the rest of your life
And eventually, the world will change

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know
But who am I if I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I recommend that you read ""The Alchemist""
Listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus
Tell the truth, regardless of the consequence
And every day, give your momma a compliment
Take your girl to the prom
But don't get too drunk hanging out the limo
Slow dance with your woman in your arms
Sneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe
Don't wake your mom up
Do yoga, learn 'bout karma
Find God, but leave the dogma
The quickest way to happiness? Learning to be selfless
Ask more questions, talk about yourself less
Study David Bowie, James Baldwin and 2Pac
Watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop
Wear a helmet, don't be stupid
Jaywalk, but look before you do it
If it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help
Get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends, 'til it melts
Go to festivals, camp, fall in love and dance
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
Take risks, cause life moves so fast
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb

Ne peux pas croire que tu n'es plus là

C'est dur de continuer
C'est comme si je me sens vide à l'intérieur sans que vous soyez ici
Je ferai n'importe quoi mec, pour te ramener

J'ai l'impression qu'hier on faisait vibrer le spectacle
J'ai inséré la chanson, tu as stoppé le flow
Loin de traîner dans la rue pour de l'argent
Notorious, ils doivent savoir que
La vie n'est pas toujours ce qu'elle semble être
Les mots ne peuvent pas exprimer ce que tu signifiais pour moi
Bien que tu sois partis, nous sommes toujours une équipe
A travers ta famille, j'accomplirai tes rêves, c'est vrai (c'est vrai)
Dans le futur, je ne peux pas attendre de voir
Si tu ouvres les portes pour moi
Je me rappelle parfois, la nuit ou il ont pris mon ami
Try to black it out, but it plays again à traduire
Quand c'est réel, les sentiments sont durs à cacher
Ne peux imaginer toute la douleur que je ressens
Je donnerai n'importe quoi pour entendre une petite respiration de ta part (Respiration)
Je sais que tu vis encore ta vie après la mort

Know you in heaven smilin' down à traduire
En nous regardant, pendant que nous prions pour toi
Chaque jour nous prions pour toi

C'est dans mon cœur que je te garderai mon ami
La mémoire me donne la force dont j'ai besoin pour continuer
La force dont j'ai besoin pour croire
My thoughts Big I just can't define à traduire
Je voudrais pouvoir faire tourner les aiguilles à l'envers

No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing

Made up of these three words that I must say to you

All because I'm the lead

So I get off stage, right? Drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks, and I'm all like:
""Sup, ladies? My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer of D12, baby""
They're all like, ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please, Marshall, please, let me suck your cock""
Now by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So, like every single night, they pick a fight with me
But when we fight, it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think they're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday, Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit is the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because these

You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And nah, I'm Swift, ""Oh, I thought you were Kuniva"" (Come on!)
And what the hell is wrong with our dressing room?
'Cause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See, I know how to rap (Uh-huh) it's simple, but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book (Yeah)
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doing jumping jacks while getting whipped on my back

Look at Em, little punk ass, thinking he the shit
Yeah, I know, man, by himself, taking all the flicks
Ayy, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue?

And our mics are screwed up! And his always sound best
You know what, man? I'ma say somethin'
Ayo, Em! You got somethin' to say?! Man, nuttin'
I thought you was about to tell him off, man, wassup?
Man, I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man, shut up

Went from sold-out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot?
I should cut his mic off when the music starts

Every time I hear, ""Hey, dude, I love your band!""

So why he get ninety, and we only get ten percent?

And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?

Changes (remake) ft. 2Pac & Talent,Noah OD,"g funk,gangster rap,hip hop,rap,west coast rap",1998-01-01,"2Pac

I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things changed, and that's the way it is

Noah Odige

People walking by
But they ain't looking in my eye
Cuz as a brother in America
I’m just destined to die
The court date is set
With a jury for the trial
Got a public defender
Who didn't even open the case file
But that's how it is in the system
Poverty always fall, victim
Tryna get some money in a way that's sad
It's just breaking bad
How we make that cash
But that's not a reason for me to get discouraged
I wanna go back to when our black brothers flourished
But everyone out here we need them to see
That we still held captive cuz freedom ain't free
But that's how its post to be
How can the law get a brother if he close to me
But the men that speak those same words
Is a brother that die before he can get heard
Now if I speak to the world that helped me make this
The sexist, misogynist, and the racist
I just speak cause we all want the hate to stop
All the violence just heard the latest pop

Talent

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

Noah Odige

Cu u know racism and discrimination
Is not just an issue of this generation
But more than hundred years in the making
It's all there ain't no faking
When we thought we made progress
It progress faster faster
Living like slaves
With hate our master
But see racism ain't a one-way street
Blacks can hate
While whites take heat
No matter the color the blood the same
We all God’s children
No matter what the claim
And we ain't enemies
We all friends
That's how we make this country great again
And that's real talk to the hater's minds
We act like this all new ain't the latest finds
But the latest news is bout gun abuse
And how any day now another bomb blew a fuse
But see all this is one-sided
We stand with love
Not hate divided
And if you stand with me
Better come with me Cuz
That's the Way It Is

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same

Look every single day ain't a game
WE live in a world that love and kill the same
Where Tomorrow ain't guaranteed or promised
Our new moniker is boy you don't want this
Gotta heater in our pockets
But when charge comes
They won't ever drop it
Cuz we our own pilots in the cockpit
We make our own bed and the beds we gon rock it
And reap what we sow
And this heap we all know
Of our brothers in love
Front seat to the gun show
Try to fight back
Is a loss and a dunzo
And no matter where we fly
People always tryna hunt us and we die
And we try to fight back with our words and pride
With our grief our fuel and our pain our guide
But see that's how it is right now
Everyone stand up just to fall down
And we act Like all this will go away
But we gotta make a change man starting today
And see we about more than just color
We a world filled with sisters and brothers
And we gotta look up and look to each other
We gotta fill with love and the hate we gon cover
And we anyone say otherwise
You don't gotta heed a word from them other guys
Cuz the harder you hate the harder you fall
We gotta let love in not build a wall

Now that you're gone
All that's left is a band of gold

But that night on our honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms

That you'll walk back through that door

They say boys don't cry
But your dad has shed a lot of tears
They say I should be a strong man
But baby, I'm still filled with fear
Sometimes I don't know who I am
Sometimes I question why I'm here
I just wanna be a good dad
Will I be? I have no idea
They say girls shouldn't be tough
And moms should raise their kids at home
But baby, I know that that isn't true
Cause your momma's the toughest person I know
I wanna raise you to be like her
And watch you show the world how to do it on your own
I'm still tryna figure out who I am
I don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong
I'm gonna be there for your first breath
I don't know if I'll be there for your first step
I can promise you that I'll try to work less
But the tour's routed, and I got this album
Put in so many hours, and I just want the outcome
To be something that I can look back and I can be proud of
Don't wanna be a dad that's living in FaceTime
But I got a world to sing to and you at the same time
I won't spoil you, you can trust that
For your sweet sixteen, you get a bus pass
Had your heart broken? Been there, done that
I love you and I can't give you enough of that
Give back to community that raised you up
Read Langston Hughes, I suggest ""A Raisin in the Sun""
Listen to Sam Cooke, a change gon' come
You put the work in, don't worry about the praise, my love
Don't try to change the world, find something that you love
And do it every day
Do that for the rest of your life
And eventually, the world will change

I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know
But who am I if I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I recommend that you read ""The Alchemist""
Listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus
Tell the truth, regardless of the consequence
And every day, give your momma a compliment
Take your girl to the prom
But don't get too drunk hanging out the limo
Slow dance with your woman in your arms
Sneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe
Don't wake your mom up
Do yoga, learn 'bout karma
Find God, but leave the dogma
The quickest way to happiness? Learning to be selfless
Ask more questions, talk about yourself less
Study David Bowie, James Baldwin and 2Pac
Watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop
Wear a helmet, don't be stupid
Jaywalk, but look before you do it
If it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help
Get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends, 'til it melts
Go to festivals, camp, fall in love and dance
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
Take risks, cause life moves so fast
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance

C'est dur de continuer
C'est comme si je me sens vide à l'intérieur sans que vous soyez ici
Je ferai n'importe quoi mec, pour te ramener

J'ai l'impression qu'hier on faisait vibrer le spectacle
J'ai inséré la chanson, tu as stoppé le flow
Loin de traîner dans la rue pour de l'argent
Notorious, ils doivent savoir que
La vie n'est pas toujours ce qu'elle semble être
Les mots ne peuvent pas exprimer ce que tu signifiais pour moi
Bien que tu sois partis, nous sommes toujours une équipe
A travers ta famille, j'accomplirai tes rêves, c'est vrai (c'est vrai)
Dans le futur, je ne peux pas attendre de voir
Si tu ouvres les portes pour moi
Je me rappelle parfois, la nuit ou il ont pris mon ami
Try to black it out, but it plays again à traduire
Quand c'est réel, les sentiments sont durs à cacher
Ne peux imaginer toute la douleur que je ressens
Je donnerai n'importe quoi pour entendre une petite respiration de ta part (Respiration)
Je sais que tu vis encore ta vie après la mort

Know you in heaven smilin' down à traduire
En nous regardant, pendant que nous prions pour toi
Chaque jour nous prions pour toi
Jusqu'au jour où l'on se reverra
C'est dans mon cœur que je te garderai mon ami
La mémoire me donne la force dont j'ai besoin pour continuer
La force dont j'ai besoin pour croire
My thoughts Big I just can't define à traduire
Je voudrais pouvoir faire tourner les aiguilles à l'envers
Nous dans la sixième, achetant de nouveaux vêtements et des baskets

Walk up to these hot chicks, and I'm all like:
""Sup, ladies? My name's Slim Shady

They're all like, ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem

Now by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So, like every single night, they pick a fight with me
But when we fight, it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think they're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday, Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be

And hear your voice of treason

Я сын своей мамы
Выучил о тройном кресте, когда был молодым и я знаю, что не пойду, так что я держу пушку

Пытаюсь потрахаться в V, это хорошо (Давай трахаться)
Мы не можем испачкать мои сиденья, потому что они белые (Это мои сиденья, смотри на мои сиденья)
Я живу, как в ""Thriller"", я выхожу только ночью

Она не пьёт Henny, только белое вино (Что она делает?)

I looked across and there I saw Billy
Waiting to go and join the line

And with her head upon his shoulder
His young and lovely fiancee
From where I stood I saw she was cryin'
And through her tears I heard her say:

""Billy, don't be a hero, don't be a fool with your life
Billy, don't be a hero, come back and make me your wife""
And as Billy started to go she said: ""Keep your pretty head low
Billy, don't be a hero, come back to me""

The battle raging all around
The sergeant cried: ""We've gotta hang on, boys
We've gotta hold this piece of ground

I need a volunteer to ride out
And bring us back some extra men""
And Billy's hand was up in a moment
Forgettin' all the words she said. She said:

""Billy, don't be a hero, don't be a fool with your life
Billy, don't be a hero, come back and make me your wife""
And as Billy started to go she said: ""Keep your pretty head low

I was in the biggest army

We were marching as one

Yeah, we raised four corners of the globe
For the holy grail

We were so far from home
So how were we to know
That there'd be nothing left to plunder
When we stumbled on the holy grail?

And those big black birds
They were circling in the sky

Sometimes you gotta drink about somebody
But that ain't goin' bring 'em back
Sometimes you gotta cry and miss somebody
Yea, we've all felt like that
If it's something that you gotta get over, but you just can't get over

[Chorus]
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
In the back of a cab or on a subway train
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
On a midnight street in the summer rain
If you're wishing you were with somebody
‘Cause you don’t wanna go home when it’s closin’ time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind

You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know just what you’re goin’ through
‘Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you

You say horrible things
I laugh because I love you

Ella toma mi dinero cuando estoy en necesidad
Sí, ella es una trivial amiga de hecho
Oh, ella es una cazafortunas
Que camina sobre la ciudad que cava en mí
(Uh)

(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas

(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante

[Verso 1: Kanye West]
Cutie la bomba, la conocí en un salón de belleza
Con un pequeño Louis Vuitton debajo del brazo
Ella dijo: ""Puedo decirte roca, puedo decirlo por tu encanto
Tan lejos como chicas, tienes un rebaño
Puedo decirlo por tu encanto y tu brazo""
Pero estoy buscando a la elegida, ¿La has visto?
Mi psíquica me dijo que tendría un culo como el de Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez; cuatro hijos
¿Y tengo que llevarme todos esos traseros malos a ShowBiz?
Okay, busca a tus hijos, pero luego ellos tienen a sus amigos
Paré en el Benz, todos se levantaron
Todos fuimos a cenar y luego tuve que pagar
Si estás follando con esta chica, será mejor que te paguen
¿Sabes por qué? Se necesita demasiado para tocarla
Por lo que escuché, ella consiguió un bebé de Busta
Mi mejor amiga dijo que solía follar con Usher
No me importa lo que ninguno de ustedes diga, todavía la amo

[Coro: Kanye West & Jamie Foxx]
(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas

[Verso 2: Kanye West]
18 años, 18 años
Ella tiene a uno de tus hijos, te atrapó durante 18 años
Sé que alguien está pagando la manutención de los hijos de uno de sus hijos
El coche y la casa de su mamá son más grandes que ella
Lo verás en la televisión cualquier domingo
Gana el Super Bowl y conduce un Hyundai
Se suponía que iba a comprar tu pequeño Tyco con tu dinero
Ella fue al doctor, se hizo liposucción con tu dinero
Ella camina luciendo como Michael con tu dinero
Debería haberlo asegurado, Geico por tu dinero
Si no eres un punk
Mucho, ""¡Queremos prenupcial! ¡Queremos prenupcial!"" (¡Sí!)
Es algo que necesitas tener
Porque cuando te deje el culo, se irá con la mitad
18 años, 18 años
¿Y en el decimoctavo cumpleaños, descubrió que no era suyo?

[Verso 3: Kanye West]
Ahora, no estoy diciendo que seas un cazafortunas, tienes necesidades
No quieres que un tipo fume, pero no puede comprar marihuana
Salen a comer, no puede pagar, no pueden irse
Hay platos en la parte de atrás, tiene que arremangarse
Pero mientras todos ustedes lavan, mírenlo
Él va a llegar a un Benz con ese Datsun
Tiene esa ambición, nena, mira sus ojos
Esta semana está fregando pisos, la próxima semana son las papas fritas
Así que quédate a su lado
Sé que hay tipos bailando, y sí, eso es bueno
Y seguirán llamando e intentandolo, pero tú te quedas bien, chica
Y cuando suba, te dejará el culo por una chica blanca

Macklemore - Good Old Days ft. Kesha (Deutsche Übersetzung),Genius Deutsche Übersetzungen,"pop rap,seattle hip hop,dance pop,pop",2017-09-22,"[Deutscher Songtext zu „Good Old Days“]

[Hook: Kesha]
Ich wünschte, jemand hätte es mir gesagt, Schatz
Eines Tages werden dies hier die guten alten Zeiten sein
All die Liebe, die du nicht vergessen wirst
Und all diese sorglosen Nächte, die du nicht bereuen wirst
Eines Tages wird sich dein ganzes Leben verändern
Du wirst die Magie der guten alten Zeiten vermissen

[Part 1: Macklemore]
Ich habe über die Band nachgedacht
Ich habe über die Fans nachgedacht
Wir waren Untergrund
Packten Merch in den 12-Personen-Transporter
In einem kleinen Club in Minnesota
Und der Schnee außerhalb der 1st Ave
Ich wollte nur meinen Namen in einem Stern
Schau jetzt, wo wir sind
Wachsen immer noch empor, wachsen immer noch empor
Ich lag in meinem bett und träumte davon, was ich einmal werde
Konnte nicht abwarten, älter zu werden, konnte nicht abwarten, jemand zu werden
Jetzt, wo ich hier bin, wünsche ich mir, wieder jung zu sein
Diese guten alten Zeiten

[Hook: Kesha]
Ich wünschte, jemand hätte es mir gesagt, Schatz
Eines Tages werden dies hier die guten alten Zeiten sein
All die Liebe, die du nicht vergessen wirst
Und all diese sorglosen Nächte, die du nicht bereuen wirst
Eines Tages wird sich dein ganzes Leben verändern
Du wirst die Magie der guten alten Zeiten vermissen

[Part 2: Macklemore]
Wünschte, ich hätte nicht gedacht, ich hätte die Antworten
Wünschte, ich hätte nicht zuerst das ganze Glas getrunken
Wünschte, ich hätte es zur Heimkehr geschafft
Den Mut aufgebracht, sie zu fragen
Wünschte, ich wäre mehr aus mir herausgekommen
Wünschte, ich hätte die Flasche zurück auf das Regal gestellt
Wünschte, ich hätte mir keine Sorgen darüber gemacht, was andere denken
Und mich wohl in mir selbst gefühlt
Hausdach offen und die Sterne darüber
Der Moment steht still, rausschleichen und sich verlieben
Ich, du und der Futon, wir hatten gerade erst angefangen
Auf dem Grass, träume, finde heraus, wer ich war
Diese guten alten Zeiten

[Hook: Kesha]
Ich wünschte, jemand hätte es mir gesagt, Schatz
Eines Tages werden dies hier die guten alten Zeiten sein
All die Liebe, die du nicht vergessen wirst
Und all diese sorglosen Nächte, die du nicht bereuen wirst
Eines Tages wird sich dein ganzes Leben verändern
Du wirst die Magie der guten alten Zeiten vermissen

[Part 3: Macklemore & Kesha]
Dachte nie, dass wir alt werden, vielleicht sind wir noch jung
Mögen wir immer zurückschauen und denken, es war besser, als es war
Vielleicht sind das die Momente
Vielleicht habe ich übersehen, um was es geht
Hatte Angst vor der Zukunft, dachte an die Vergangenheit
Während ich das Jetzt verpasste
Wir kamen so weit, ich denke, ich bin stolz
Und ich bin nicht besorgt wegen den Falten um mein Lächeln
Ich habe ein paar Narben, ich bin erfahren
Ich habe etwas Schmerz verursacht, ein paar Dinge gesehen, aber ich bin jetzt hier
Diese guten alten Zeiten

Du weißt nicht, was du hast
Bis es geht, bis es weg ist
Du weißt nicht, was du hast

Did we squander the chance?

And still we try
To justify the waste

Have we peaked too soon?

Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man

A pair of 45's made me open my eyes

Just a 5'9"" beautiful tall
With just one look I was a bad mess

With a tall walking big black cat
Well, Charlie said ""I hope that you're able, boy
'Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at""
When suddenly we heard the sirens
And everybody started to run
I jumped down and across the table
When I heard somebody shooting a gun

Well, the DA was pumping my left hand
And then she was a-holding my right
Well, I told her ""Don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared""

Love the Fall,Michael Paynter,,2010-06-18,"[Verse 1: Michael Paynter with The Veronicas]
I remember the time when I was searching my mind
Just to find out if I'd ever define who I am
Could I ever afford to consider being bought?
I was sure that I saw all the world, but I keep wishing for more
So I keep checking my direction, watching my own reflection
Am I still, still in connection with the way I wanna be?
Did I behave? 'Cause I've been stuck here for days
I'm in a daze, had the chance to be a saviour, but I threw it away

[Chorus: Michael Paynter & The Veronicas, Michael Paynter]
What if I dive off the edge of my life and there's nothing beneath?
What if I live like there's nothing to lose just to die on my knees?
At least I'll know, I walked the door, I took the scars, I risked it all
And learned to love the fall

[Verse 2: Michael Paynter with The Veronicas]
I could never say how it hurts, to feel the worst
I never make it, even though I rehearse
But I won't be that type of guy that never tried
That never took a chance or took his moment to fly, to be free
And you may be of the opinion that I'm making the wrong decision
That I'm giving up the chance to live my life with your vision
But I can't give up, no, I won't give up
Until you see that okay is never ever enough

Guilty Conscience (Radio Version),Eminem,"detroit hip hop,hip hop,rap,g funk,gangster rap,hip hop,rap,west coast rap",1999-02-23,"[Intro: Mark Avery & Eddie]
Meet Eddie, 23 years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
(Goddamn, I'm going fucking insane)
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre, Eminem, & (Eddie)]
Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your mother****** conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Bump that, do that sh**, hit that lick
Can you afford to blow this hit? Are you that rich?
Why you care if you scared of death? Are you that chick?
Do you really think she gives a **** if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)
Not over this slit (Stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude

[Chorus: Eminem & Mark Avery]
These voices, these voices, I hear them (Hear them, hear them)
And when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow
(All these voices, these voices) Meet Stan, 21 years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party (I hear them)
(And when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow)
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
(I'll follow, I'll follow)
Once again, his conscience comes into play (All these)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little chicken's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
How could you take advantage of her? She's passed out
It's easy, just cut these lights out, that's how
Then pick this chicken up, get her off Brad's couch
And leave her on the front porch at her mom and dad's house
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest (Doobiest)
You wanna get hauled off to jail?
Bump that, drop her off, ring the doorbell, then bail

I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow (I'll follow)
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker
(These voices, these voices, I hear them, hear them)

He walks in the door of his trailer park home

To find his wife in bed with another man

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Start breathin'? Man, you just caught your wife cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Forget gettin' divorced, cut this chicken's head off
Wait, what if there's a good explanation for this?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his ****?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna grab her?
Kick her our the house, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?

The Man knows I won’t reach way up
Way up like his reaches do

And anywhere has got to be better than here

The last fallen clown?

Pray himself at night to stay sane

To get out of his wrath
But just like a man
He always comes back

He takes what he needs and he never loses ground

Just a little additive to your education

Throw your hands up if you're down with the C-
Double O-L-I-O with the flow

Learn To Fly,Shannon Noll,"australian country,australian pop,australian rock",2004-02-02,"When you feel the dream is over
Feel the world is on your shoulders
And you've lost the strength to carry on
Even though the walls may crumble
And you find you always stumble through
Remember never to surrender to the dark
Cos if you turn another page
You will see that's not the way, The story has to end

[Chorus:]
If you need to find a way back
Feel you're on the wrong track
Give it time, Learn to fly
Tomorrow is a new day
You will find you're own way
You'll be stronger with each day that you cry
Then you'll learn to fly
In you're head so many questions
The truth is your possession
The answer lies within your heart
You will see the doors are open
If you only dare to hope and you
Will find the way to fight the fears that kept you down
Cos if you turn another page
You will see that's not the way
The story has to end

[Chorus:]
Looking at your situation
There's so much that you can do
Now's the time to make your stand
This is just an observation
In the end it's up to you
The future's in your hands

Water in the milk from a hole in the roof

Crying because she doesn't have a dress without a patch
For the party to go
But you know she'll get by

A long, long time ago
I can still remember how that music
Used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

[Chorus]
So, bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

[Verse 2]
Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now, do you believe in rock 'n' roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

[Chorus]
I started singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

[Verse 3]
Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lenin read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

[Chorus]
We were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

[Verse 4]
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now, the halftime air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

[Chorus]
We started singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

[Verse 5]
Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So, come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
[Deleted Verse]
And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised Him everything I could give
If only He would make the music live
And He promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn

And they were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry

I suppose that moving on paints a new colour for each day
I dont like to see dreams put on the shelf
To deal with on that one day
I just want to be happy for you

Cause i only have one second, this minute today
Can't press rewind and turn it back and call it now
And so this moment i just have to sing out loud
I say i love i like and breathe in now
And say i love i live and breathe in now

I move on holding on to what i learn
It's time to let go of the notion
That the whole world's against me
Break free of shackles that formed young
Time free in now and now i know
Its not all up to me, i can count on another
So move on lighter and be free

Cause i only have one second, this minute today
Can't press rewind and turn it back and call it now
And so this moment i just have to sing out loud
I say i love i like and breathe in now
And say i love i live and breathe in

We're all misunderstood

With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
And ""gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it
[Trombone Interlude]
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause, progress, march on
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
When kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up, sing
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to

Blame it on the train, but the boss is already there

Of all of my nights, why did my lover have to pick
Last night to get down? (Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter that I have to feed the both of us?
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
""C'mon, honey, let's go make some noise"" (I can't resist)
Time, it goes so fast (When you're having fun)

Listen boy I don't want to see you let a good thing slip away
You know I don't like watching anybody make the same mistakes I made

[Bridge 1]
She's a real nice girl and she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do

[Verse 2]
Oh, listen boy I'm sure that you think you got it all under control
You don't want somebody telling you the way to stay in someone's soul

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're a big boy now and you'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing she ought to know

[Chorus 1]
Tell her about it, tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that you're for real
Tell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her, let her know how much she means

[Verse 3]
Listen boy it's not automatically a certain guarantee
To ensure yourself you've got to provide communication constantly
[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you love someone, you're always insecure
And there's only one good way to reassure

[Chorus 2]
Tell her about it, let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you, tell her you wish you were there
Tell her about it, every day before you leave
Pay her some attention, give her something to believe

[Bridge 2]
Cause now and then she'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken for so long
And though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone?

[Verse 4]
Listen boy it's good information from a man who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you could be the difference that it makes

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She's a trusting soul, she's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you what you should do

Tell her about it, tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that you're for real
Tell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her, let her know how much she means

I can't see no room for improvement
Why you all over there on your Jack Jones?
You need to let me get behind your backbone
'Cause I'm the man for the job, let me work it
I won't waste no time, I'll make it worth it
One hundred percent, I'll make it perfect
You got a body to die for, let me merk it
Now it's murder on the dance floor
I wanna take this further than the dance floor
I ain't forceful but I'm still hardcore
You're gonna give me everything I ask for
It's not a long ting, you're the boom ting
Maybe more than a hotel room ting

Burn a big whole in your belly, like indigestion
With one question, who the fuck is Dogmatic
An underground nigga but this nigga's above average

Kanye West - Homecoming ft. Chris Martin (Русский перевод),Genius Russian Translations (Русский перевод),"chicago rap,hip hop,rap",2007-09-11,"[Интро: Kanye West]
Да
И ты говоришь Чикаго!
Чикаго! Чикаго!

[Припев: Chris Martin & Kanye West]
Я снова возвращаюсь домой
Ты хоть изредка обо мне думаешь? (Да)
Ты хоть изредка обо мне думаешь?
Потому что я снова возвращаюсь домой
Снова возвращаюсь домой

[Куплет 1: Kanye West]
Я встретил эту девушку, когда мне было 3 года
И в то время, меня больше всего зацепила её душа
Она сказала: «Прости, малыш, я знаю, что мы не знакомы
Но меня зовут Уинди и мне нравится курить травку»
И с того момента я никогда с ней не расставался
Мне нравилось хвастаться ею перед парнями из других городов
Они изображают из себя крутых, а она их ловко отшивает
И заставляет их исправится, потому что знает, что мягкие в душе
Когда я вырос, она показала мне, как нужно тусоваться в центре
А каждую ночь её лицо так потрясающе светилось
Я сказал ей, что она навсегда останется в моём сердце
Она никогда не связывалась с артистами, ведь они всегда куда-то уезжают
Она говорила: «Такое ощущение, будто меня просто растопчут»
Знала, что я был связан с бандами, попал в телевизор и она на меня настучала
Наверное, поэтому она и охладела ко мне прошлой зимой
Она сказала: «Йе, продолжай получать, продолжай получать платиновые и золотые пластинки ради меня!»

[Припев: Chris Martin]
Я снова возвращаюсь домой
Ты хоть изредка обо мне думаешь?
Ты хоть изредка обо мне думаешь?
Потому что я снова возвращаюсь домой
Снова возвращаюсь домой
Ты хоть изредка обо мне думаешь?
Ты хоть изредка обо мне думаешь? О!
Сейчас я снова возвращаюсь домой
Может мы можем начать всё заново

[Куплет 2: Kanye West]
Но если бы она была тебе по-настоящему дорога
Тогда ты никогда не поехал бы в аэропорт в погоне за мечтой
Иногда я всё ещё с ней общаюсь
Но когда я разговариваю с ней, мне всегда кажется, будто она говорит только обо мне
Она сказала: “Ты оставил своих детей, а они так похожи на тебя
Они хотят читать рэп и делать биты, прям как и ты
Но они не ты,” и я только что через это прошёл
Говоря о том, что всё, что делают другие — уже давно не новость
Сейчас все осознают, что они неправильно понимали правила этой игры
Похоже, ты начинаешь ценить что-то только когда теряешь
Похоже, поэтому я здесь и не могу вернуться домой
И угадай, когда я это понял? Когда я вернулся домой
Я говорю о тебе в каждом интервью, ты можешь мною гордиться
Всегда тянись к звёздам, ведь даже если упадёшь, то приземлишься на облака
Прыгай в толпе, зажги зажигалку и размахивай руками
Если ты всё ещё не понимаешь, я говорю о Чикаго

[Припев: Chris Martin]
Я снова возвращаюсь домой
Ты хоть изредка обо мне думаешь?
Ты хоть изредка обо мне думаешь?
Потому что я снова возвращаюсь домой
Снова возвращаюсь домой
Детка, а ты помнишь
Фейерверки на озере Мичиган? Оу!
Сейчас я снова возвращаюсь домой
Снова возвращаюсь домой
Детка, а ты помнишь
Фейерверки на озере Мичиган? Оу!
Сейчас я снова возвращаюсь домой

Ain't slowin' it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel

Cremate my body and let the ocean have what's left of me
Καιω το σωμα μου και αφηνω τον ωκεανο να παρει οτι απεμεινε απο εμενα
But for now forget about that

[Giriş: RAYE]
Edepsizlik yapıyorum ve sataşıyorum, onun üstünde oturuyorum
Tüm elmaslarım onun üstüne ışıldıyor
Onunla barda buluştum, saat on iki veya öyle bir şeydi
İki şarap daha istedim çünkü bu gece onu istiyorum

[Bölüm 1: RAYE]
Eğer umurunda olacaksa sana olaydan biraz bahsedeyim
Kendimi berbat bir durumun içinde buluyorum
Sevdiğim adam geçen gece beni karşısına oturttu
Ve bana her şeyin bittiğini söyledi, aptalca bir karar
Ve ben kalbimin nasıl parçalandığını hissetmek istemiyorum
Aslında, hissetmek istemiyorum, bu yüzden içmeye devam ediyorum
Ve ben bugün basit bir görevle şehirdeyim
Küçük siyah elbisemin içinde, üstüme de baya bir oturuyor

[Ön-Nakarat: RAYE]
Sadece kalbi kırık bir kaltak, topuklu ayakkabı 15 santimetre
Gece kulübünün arkasında, şampanya yudumluyorum
Takıldığım bu kaltaklara güvenmiyorum
Taksinin arkasında kokain çekiyorum
Sarhoş aramalar, sarhoş mesajlar, sarhoş yaşlar, sarhoş seks
Benimle aynı kafada bir adam arıyordum
Şimdi başa dönüş, bara dönüş
Bentley'e, otele, eski alışkanlıklarıma

[Nakarat: RAYE]
Çünkü geçen geceki gibi hissetmek istemiyorum
Geçen geceki gibi hissetmek istemiyorum
Doktor, doktor, herhangi bir şey, lütfen
Doktor, doktor, bana acı
Bu acıyı al
Belirtilerimi soruyorsun, doktor, hissetmek istemiyorum

[Bölüm 2: RAYE]
Bu esrarı içiyorum, stresimi böyle atıyorum
2019 gibi eski alışkanlıklarıma döndüm
Eski sevgilimin bitirmesinin üstünden 24 saat bile geçmedi
Üstümde yeni bir adam, biraz terlemek üzereyiz
Geçen gece çok mükâfatlıydı
Kötü günler geçirdim ve bu baya bir canımı yakıyor
Beni mazur gör, benim yatağıma girme umutların
Ne kadar yüksekse benim de kafam o kadar iyi
Bardağı yarı dolu görmek için geri adım atarsam
En azından bu iki parça Prada içinde dolaşıyorum
Ve ben çoktan pislik gibi davranıyorum, ne dediğimi anlıyor musun?
Boş boş duracağına içime sok

Yo, what's attracting people to the life of fame?
The nights away binging, getting blind for days
Would you expect a tidal wave of guys
All disguised as mates to try to take a slice of that pie you made?
When you're famous, you're the person people like to hate
Are you prepared for all the rumours and the lies they say?
Yo, looking back at life, I'd never thought I'd go this far
Yo, I'm just thankful people welcomed me with open arms
All these new friends and people that I hope to trust
Try to take advantage, got me thinking what their motives are?

But I would rather help my mates in debt and pay their rent
Yo, I could make a trip to ATMs at 8AM
After I've been placing bets and partying for days on end
But what'll happen if I never see the same success?
Yo, in the schemes of things, I think there's better ways to spend

Not Over You,Gavin DeGraw,"neo mellow,pop rock",2011-09-16,"[Verse 1]
Dreams; that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope; hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then, it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally, I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you (Not over you)

[Verse 2]
Damn, damn, girl, you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still, you're magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me (Old me)
But I'm not even close without you

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

You'd better be home soon

Of lies and deception
Back to nothingness

Wake up in the morning, take a breath and let it out
Just forget tomorrow's ever gonna come around
Everybody's medicating, taking time and waiting for the right time
In the short life, but it's your life
We can run around in circles we make or we could run straight ahead
Never ever let the moment pass by when all that matters in the end

If you love someone, then tell them right now

When true love is staring you in the face
But the words that you're feeling never find their way
You're so invisible to the one you want
And you'd give anything to win their love

But there in the dark you find that the stars are shining their brightest light

With broken glass for us to hold

Act Your Age,Bliss n Eso,australian hip hop,2013-06-28,"[Intro: Jake Stone]
When I wake up

[Verse 1: Bliss]
When I wake in the morning, I smile to myself like I'm thanking God
Shit, no more folks like, ""Jonathan, when you gonna grow up and get a job?"" (Uh-uh)
'Cause I made that job, no Steve, that job's kept me hungry and foolish (Yup)
It's the coolest, I'ma dive in like Kendrick and drink some rum in the pool, bitch
Or beers on the roof, it's the workaholic in the magic sun
Till the esky is empty, shit, what's life if you ain't having fun?
So forget your age and those walls, I'm bursting through that maze
On top of the tour bus in a teen wolf mask surfing USA
And we got that baggage packed, happy gas, massive laughs, yes, I can dig it
So I joke like Tom when I Josh, basking in these toys like a big kid
It's my habitat, I can't leave the trees like an Orangutan, I'ma
Running on air anchorman and I never land like Bangarang

[Chorus: Jake Stone]
Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?
Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?
You know what I'm saying, yo, enough of that shit, check that

[Verse 2: Eso]
Yo, I'm acting the fool, no shame, I came, I shat in the pool
Yeah, better pass that blunt, I'm 'bout, 'bout it, you can ask my Mum
She'll tell ya, I'm psycho mate, my ideas make your lightbulbs break
I make it look so damn easy when I rock that Borat mankini
Fuck what they say, you don't miss your chance to eat chocolate cake with your hands
You rock a bubble beard while you're taking a bath and where a simple fart still makes you laugh, like
Hahahaha, blurp blurp, hahaha
And then a big brown shark came, now I'm
On the stage acting up, yelling bombs away while I grab my nuts
Still living it like it's all a movie, still killing shit on Call of Duty
And I still think I can move like the Matrix, real shit, shrooming in Vegas
Or when I play with my dogs, even right now while I'm making this song
So how's about it, let's laugh till there's power outage
That's all I have to say, fuck them all, and don't act your age, I'm makin’ pancakes

[Chorus (Extended): Jake Stone]
Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?
Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?

Either we all gon' clap, or somebody gon' get clapped
And I'm not down with that, sure as my name's Vin Rock
In '99 I will officially re-open up the block
And dedicate my life to preservation of hip-hop
I'm tired of seein the people of my culture gettin shot
And now I must step up because I know that's all we got
I must do it, pursue it, before all the maggots make it rot
Hip-Hop, it ain't gon' die, it's gon' diversify
And as long as I'm alive, I'm gon' promote the I
And no matter how many people try to use or difuse it

But the time bombs ticking, I can never sleep

All der andere Scheiß, über den ich rede, sie denken sie wissen es
Ich habe gebetet, damit mich jemand rettet, keiner ist heldenhaft

Ich weiß es, ich weiß es, ich weiß, dass ich tief in mir verletzt bin, aber kann es nicht zeigen

Und wenn du deine Reflektion anstarrst
Endlich zu wissen wer es ist
Ich weiß, dass du Gott danken wirst, dass du es getan hast

Ich weiß wo du warst, wo du bist, wohin du gehst
