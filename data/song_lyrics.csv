Underneath the chandelier

There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside

While I kiss your neck and shoulders

[Intro: Rihanna & Jay Z]
Lo siento viniendo en el aire (Sí)
Escucho los gritos en todos lados (Sí)
Soy adicta a la emoción (Estoy listo)
Es un amorío peligroso (¿Qué pasa? Vamos)
No puedo asustarme cuando eso viene bajo
Tienes un problema, dímelo ahora (¿Qué pasa?)
La única cosa que está en mi mente (¿Qué pasa?)
Es quién va a dirigir esta ciudad esta noche (Ah, ¿Qué pasa?)
Es quién va a dirigir esta ciudad esta noche (Sí, ¿Qué pasa? Sí)
Nosotros vamos a dirigir esta ciudad

[Verso 1: Jay Z]
Lo hacemos, sí, yo dije: lo hacemos
Este es Roc Nation, jura tu fidelidad
Ten tu uniforme puesto, de negro todo
Tarjetas negras, autos nеgros, de negro todo
Y nuestras chicas son pájaros nеgros yendo con los Dillinger
Profundizo más si estos chicos son lo suficientemente reales
Este es la Familia, te lo explicaré luego
Pero por ahora, déjame volver a este papel
Tengo un par de billetes guardados y estoy tratando de volver
Le di un apretón a Doug y perdí un flip por cinco pilas
Sí, estoy hablando de 5 comas, 6 ceros, punto cero, aquí Doug
De vuelta a correr en círculos alrededor de los negros, ahora nos cuadramos
Espera

[Estribillo: Rihanna & Jay Z]
La vida es un juego, pero no es justo (Sí)
Rompo las reglas, así que no me importa (Uh-huh)
Así que sigo haciendo mi propia cosa
Caminando alto contra la lluvia (¿Qué pasa?)
La victoria está dentro de la milla
Casi allí, no te rindas ahora (¿Qué pasa?)
La única cosa que está en mi mente (¿Qué pasa?)
Es quién va a dirigir esta ciudad esta noche (Uh, sí)
Ey, ey, ey, ey (¿Qué pasa?)
¿Quién va a dirigir esta ciudad esta noche?

[Verso 2: Jay Z]
Lo hacemos, sí, yo dije: lo hacemos
Tú puedes llamarme Caesar, en un Caesar negro
Por favor sigue al líder, asi que, Eric B, lo hacemos
Microfono cruel, este es el regreso del dios
Paz, Dios, ah, ah, no hay nadie más fresco
Estoy en Maison, ah, Martin Margiela
En la mesa, gritando, ""Al carajo el otro lado! Ellos andan celosos!""
Tenemos un banquete lleno de chicas, ellas tienen una mesa llena de muchachos
Sí, y no están gastando en ningún pastel
Ellos deberían tirar sus manos allí porque ellos no tienen ninguna pica
Sí, todo mi equipo tiene dinero
Así que mi banquete se parece a ""Millionaires' Row""

[Verso 3: Kanye West, Jay-Z]
Está loco como tú puedes ir de ser Joe Blow
A que todos estén en tu pene; no homo
Le compré a mi familia entera carros; no Volvos
La próxima vez estoy en la Iglesia: por favor, sin fotos
Escoltas policiales, pasaportes de todos
Esta es la vida que todos piden
Esta es la vida rápida, estamos en un curso acelerado
¿Para qué crees que rapeo, para promocionar un jodido Rav 4?
Pero sé que si me quedo atrofiado
Todas estas chicas solo van a querer una cosa
Puedo pasar toda mi vida de Good Will Hunting
Lo único bueno que viene es tan bueno cuando me ando viniendo
Ella tiene un culo que se tragará una tanga
Y por arriba, ungh, dos picaduras de abeja
Y estoy bebiendo el Riesling
Y mi negro acaba de salir de la comisaría
Nos importa un carajo el drama que tu amigo trae
Solo estoy tratando de cambiar el color de tu anillo de estado de ánimo
Reebok, nena, necesitas probar algunas cosas nuevas
¿Alguna vez has tenido zapatos sin cordones?
""¿Qué es eso, Ye?"" ""Nena, estos son tacones""
""Es eso un May— ¡¿Qué?!"" ""Nena estas son ruedas""
Te equivocas cuando no estás bebiendo, toma una recarga
Te sientes como si estuvieras corriendo, ¿huh? Ahora ya sabes cómo nos sentimos (¿Qué pasa?)

"Same Love","Macklemore","pop rap,seattle hip hop,neo mellow","2012-10-09","[Piano Intro]
[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
And ""gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it
[Trombone Interlude]
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause, progress, march on
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
When kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up, sing
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

You speak the truth, you speak to me
You feel the love I have yet to find
I know it's there, I know it's there
But I let the sandcastles kill my mind
Pathetic me, I long to be you
I think I'm close but I stand so far
The turbulent one sheds a turbulent tear
I miss the love only cause they starve
Oil and water, lust and sympathy
I life and death my way through the sun
Where originates all the pain that leaves
My memory a traumatic sponge and sings to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Well define my love with attitude
Open up your mind and it will sing to you
You can always tell
But I know remorse so well
I left reality early due to the lack of love, reason

[Chorus]
Whatever it is I do
I try to think about you
I have a love for you that nothing hides
Whatever it is I do
I'm only thinking of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes

[Verse 2]
The channel, a professional liar
How I long to contradict those vibes
Joni help me, I think I'm falling
It's not the love and I quest the why
I don't know, If I'm right, I'm right
But if I'm wrong then show me I'm wrong
The fear of pity is always awake
But infinite sympathy's completely gone
It's the windows, the doors
The passageways to the truth
Oh my God, it echoes the mind
In total recall as wild as the deuce
And so deceiving is the clouded heart
So superficial is the open wound
I caress the infinite light
That even at night overshadows the moon that sings to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, define my love, that lives within you
Even when I die, it will sing to you
You can only tell if remorse has done you well
The misconstrued my answers due to the lack of love, reason

[Chorus 2]
Whatever it is I do
I try to think about you
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie
Whatever it is I do
I'm only thinkin' of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes
Whatever it is I do
I try to think about you
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie
Whatever it is I do

I'm in the club so damn gone

Don't even know how I'll get home
But its OK its alright
I'm so fresh yes, I'm so fly
I swore last night id give up drinking
Such a lie what was i thinking

I see them moving, see them dancing
Yeah they're doing that
I see them grooving poppin' bottles
Like its new to them
I wanna join them but it seems
Like they're too far for me
Plus where's the bathroom man
Cause i really really got to pee

I said I'd never last night
What was i thinking?
I really need to give up drinking
I'm not gon' drink again
But who am I kiddin'

And do it over again

Fresh out the bath room so relieved
I make my way up to the VIP

And i check my fresh
Then i proceed ta-to my mission

And the vodka's glistening
Good Lord they look so lovely
Pardon me while i chase this bubbly

And I'm pantin'
Oh and I'm shakin'

Early in the mornin' time
Late in the middle of the night
Whenever this chill comes over me
I wanna hug ya' with all of my might
That's right and I'm sweatin'
Oh, yeah ya' got me shakin'
Mmm, ya' got me sweatin'
Oh, yeah ya' got me shakin' girl

A chill and a fever, so I've been told
Makes your head spin around and your feet run cold
I got fever, yeah
Fever yeah I burn forsooth

I feel like I been run right through the mill
And I can't move around and I can't stand still
I'm Bo Diddley
Oh, you got me shakin'
I'm so jittery
That's right, you got me shakin'

Well Samson was a mighty good man
Strongest in his day
(Then along came Delilah and clipped his wig)
And it looks like you took me the same old way
So I'm nervous
Oh and I'm shakin'
Alright, you got me nervous
Yeah, I'm shakin' and jumpin'

A storm rocks a ship on a sea (A storm rocks a ship on a sea)
The wind shakes the leaves on a tree (The wind shakes the leaves on a tree)
And I'm a nervous wreck and I'm all shook up
And that's what you're doin' to me right now

You found out to love me you have to climb some fences
Scratching and crawling along the floor to touch you
And just when it feels right
You say you found someone to hold you

Does she stimulate you, attract and captivate you?
Tell me, does she miss you, existing just to kiss you

Does she know just how to shock you, electrify and rock you?
Does she inject you, seduce you and affect you

I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things changed, and that's the way it is

Noah Odige

People walking by
But they ain't looking in my eye
Cuz as a brother in America
I’m just destined to die
The court date is set
With a jury for the trial
Got a public defender
Who didn't even open the case file
But that's how it is in the system
Poverty always fall, victim
Tryna get some money in a way that's sad
It's just breaking bad
How we make that cash
But that's not a reason for me to get discouraged
I wanna go back to when our black brothers flourished
But everyone out here we need them to see
That we still held captive cuz freedom ain't free
But that's how its post to be
How can the law get a brother if he close to me
But the men that speak those same words
Is a brother that die before he can get heard
Now if I speak to the world that helped me make this
The sexist, misogynist, and the racist
I just speak cause we all want the hate to stop
All the violence just heard the latest pop

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is

Noah Odige

Cu u know racism and discrimination
Is not just an issue of this generation
But more than hundred years in the making
It's all there ain't no faking
When we thought we made progress
It progress faster faster
Living like slaves
With hate our master
But see racism ain't a one-way street
Blacks can hate
While whites take heat
No matter the color the blood the same
We all God’s children
No matter what the claim
And we ain't enemies
We all friends
That's how we make this country great again
And that's real talk to the hater's minds
We act like this all new ain't the latest finds
But the latest news is bout gun abuse
And how any day now another bomb blew a fuse
But see all this is one-sided
We stand with love
Not hate divided
And if you stand with me
Better come with me Cuz
That's the Way It Is

WE live in a world that love and kill the same
Where Tomorrow ain't guaranteed or promised

Gotta heater in our pockets
But when charge comes
They won't ever drop it
Cuz we our own pilots in the cockpit
We make our own bed and the beds we gon rock it
And reap what we sow
And this heap we all know
Of our brothers in love
Front seat to the gun show
Try to fight back
Is a loss and a dunzo
And no matter where we fly
People always tryna hunt us and we die
And we try to fight back with our words and pride
With our grief our fuel and our pain our guide
But see that's how it is right now
Everyone stand up just to fall down
And we act Like all this will go away
But we gotta make a change man starting today
And see we about more than just color
We a world filled with sisters and brothers
And we gotta look up and look to each other
We gotta fill with love and the hate we gon cover
And we anyone say otherwise
You don't gotta heed a word from them other guys
Cuz the harder you hate the harder you fall
We gotta let love in not build a wall

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Saludos, queridos
Vamos a hacer un viaje

[Verso 1: Katy Perry]
Conozco un lugar en donde el pasto es realmente más verde
Caliente, húmedo y salvaje
Debe de haber algo en el agua
Sorbiendo ginebra y zumo
Tumbadas bajo palmeras (Deshecha)
Los chicos, se rompen el cuello
Intentando pegarnos un pequeño vistazo (A nosotras)

[Pre-coro]
Puedes viajar por el mundo
Pero nada se acerca a la costa dorada
Una vez que vayas de fiesta con nosotras
Te estarás enamorando
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Coro]
Chicas de California, somos inolvidables
Pantalones muy cortos y bikinis
Una piel besada por el sol, tan caliente, derretiremos tu paleta
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Chicas de California, somos indiscutibles
Atractivas, descaradas, feroces, eso lo tenemos por norma
Representantes de la costa oeste, ahora, levanta la mano
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verso 2: Katy Perry]
Sexo (Sexo) en la playa
No nos importa la arena en nuestros tacones
Nos volvemos locas en mi jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg en el estéreo, oh-oh

[Verso 3]
En tono, moreno, en forma y listo
Sube el volumen porque se está poniendo duro
Salvaje, salvaje costa oeste
Estas son las chicas que más quiero
Quiero decir las únicas, quiero decir, ella es la única
Besarla, acariciarla, pellizcarla en el trasero
La chica es un fenómeno
Conduce un jeep y vive en la playa
Estoy bien, no jugaré
Me encanta la bahía, tanto como me gusta Los Angeles
Venice Beach y Palm Springs
El verano lo es todo
Los pandilleros, montándoselo
Todo ese trasero, pasando el rato
Bikinis, calabacines, martinis, nada de salchichas
Solo el rey y la reina
Katy, mi señora (¿Sí?)
Hey, mira aquí nena (Uh-huh)
Te estoy acosando
Porque tú representas a California (Oh-oh, sí)

A pretty woman makes her husband look small
And very often causes his downfall
As soon as he marries her then she starts
To do the things that will break his heart

But if you make an ugly woman your wife
You'll be happy for the rest of your life
An ugly woman cooks meals on time
She'll always give you peace of mind

If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So for my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you

Don't let your friends say you have no taste
Go ahead and marry anyway
Though her face is ugly, her eyes don't match
Take it from me, she's a better catch

If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife

It's not the same as when I was punched
In the old days, there was enough
The card games and knees with the bitter salt of blood
I was in, but I want out
My mother's love is choking me
I'm sick of words that hang above my head:
""What about the kid?"" It's time the kid got free

Go get punched for the love club

I joined the club and it's all on
There are fights for being my best friend
And the girls get their claws out
There's somethin' about hanging out with the wicked kids
Take the pill, make it too real
The other day I forgot my old address
I'm sittin' pretty on the throne
There's nothing more I want, except to be alone

So drop your chin and take yourself back home
And roll out your maps and papers
Find out your hiding places again
The only problem that I got with the club
Is how you're severed from the people who watched you grow up
When you're a member, go on your great adventure again
And we'll be waiting at the end

They say boys don't cry
But your dad has shed a lot of tears
They say I should be a strong man
But baby, I'm still filled with fear
Sometimes I don't know who I am
Sometimes I question why I'm here
I just wanna be a good dad
Will I be? I have no idea
They say girls shouldn't be tough
And moms should raise their kids at home
But baby, I know that that isn't true
Cause your momma's the toughest person I know
I wanna raise you to be like her
And watch you show the world how to do it on your own
I'm still tryna figure out who I am
I don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong
I'm gonna be there for your first breath
I don't know if I'll be there for your first step
I can promise you that I'll try to work less
But the tour's routed, and I got this album
Put in so many hours, and I just want the outcome
To be something that I can look back and I can be proud of
Don't wanna be a dad that's living in FaceTime
But I got a world to sing to and you at the same time
I won't spoil you, you can trust that
For your sweet sixteen, you get a bus pass
Had your heart broken? Been there, done that
I love you and I can't give you enough of that
Give back to community that raised you up
Read Langston Hughes, I suggest ""A Raisin in the Sun""
Listen to Sam Cooke, a change gon' come
You put the work in, don't worry about the praise, my love
Don't try to change the world, find something that you love
And do it every day
Do that for the rest of your life
And eventually, the world will change

You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb

But who am I if I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I recommend that you read ""The Alchemist""
Listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus
Tell the truth, regardless of the consequence
And every day, give your momma a compliment
Take your girl to the prom
But don't get too drunk hanging out the limo
Slow dance with your woman in your arms
Sneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe
Don't wake your mom up
Do yoga, learn 'bout karma
Find God, but leave the dogma
The quickest way to happiness? Learning to be selfless
Ask more questions, talk about yourself less
Study David Bowie, James Baldwin and 2Pac
Watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop
Wear a helmet, don't be stupid
Jaywalk, but look before you do it
If it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help
Get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends, 'til it melts
Go to festivals, camp, fall in love and dance
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
Take risks, cause life moves so fast
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance

Cheer up Brian, you know what they say?
Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best
And...

[Chorus]
Always look on the bright side of life
(Whistle)
Always look on the light side of life

[Verse 1]
If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly, chumps

Always look on the right side of life

You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow

They're all like, ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem

Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas

Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So, like every single night, they pick a fight with me
But when we fight, it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think they're tryna steal the light from me

And what the hell is wrong with our dressing room?
'Cause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See, I know how to rap (Uh-huh) it's simple, but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book (Yeah)
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doing jumping jacks while getting whipped on my back

At the dice game, who told you put a G up?

But when I come around y'all niggas better act right

Ever searching for what we were promised
Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go
But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?

This feeling inside me

Baby boy, yeah

From the day that I saw you
I knew that we would pursue
'Cause the chemistry we felt that day
Felt so real, and so true
Looking back on a year we spent together
How it's been, what we went through
Although we've had our little ups and downs
We've still pulled through

Baby girl, you're my world, my everything
I wanna lace you with diamonds and every ring
Give you everything you dream and fantasize
'Cause you can tell me that you love me looking in my eyes
You keep it real with me
I keep it real with you
You keep on loving me
I'll keep on loving you
Keep doing what you do
I feel your whole aura
And I can't wait to hook up again tomorrow, baby - what

[Chorus]
My love for you will never end
You'll always be a part of me
As long as time keeps on passing by
You'll always be my baby boy

Everytime I look at you
I can't believe I've found a love so true (and)
I took my time to put my trust in you
I must admit it was so hard to do
And every minute that I spend with you
You make me believe I have nothing to lose
And
Deep down I always knew
That you would be mine

Do you believe in destiny
Because I got a funny feeling
This was meant to be
Without you I'd be lost
I need you next to me
Preferably in the house full of luxuries and little kids
From day one I was sprung
Knew you was gonna be one
'Cause my heart spoke for the very first time in a long while
And every time you smile
I can see us walking up the aisle
With you carrying my child
C'mon

[Chorus]
My love for you will never end
You'll always be a part of me
As long as time keeps on passing by
You'll always be my baby boy

If you were to go, I don't know
You're the only one who sweeps me off my feet
Makes my soul go weak
The only one who makes my heart wanna beat
And I, I could never live without you
You know that what I feel has to be true
'Cause you're my, my sweet love

Ever since the first time that I looked into your eyes
I knew that you were gonna be mine
Feeling you from the inside
When you're not by my side
You're the only girl that's on my mind
I never knew a love like this, a love so strong
A vision so picture perfect it could never be wrong
Along the way, you're gonna see you belong with Jay
I might have to marry you one day, baby, eh...
