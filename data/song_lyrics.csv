I'm in transit
Floating, stranded on this boat
And I pledge my self allegiance
To a better night's sleep at home
And the sweet, sweet sun's comin' down hard
The sun's comin' down hard, it burns the bones
So hold a hand for cover, hold a hand for cover
Hold a hand for cover from harm

[Chorus]
Woo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-ooh
Talk, don't change a thing
Woo-oo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-oo-ooh

Oh, it's fading, fader

[Verse 2]
Bless this mess
We tried our best, that's all that we can do
While the angels walk with the lonely ones
In the cold rain to rescue you
And this fable world's comin' down hard
The wall's comin' down hard on all our homes
So hold a hand for cover, hold a hand for cover
Hold a hand for cover from harm

I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt ten years older
But fuck it, it was somethin' to do
I'm livin' out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes
[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowin' why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that rollercoaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowin' who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singin', stuck up on that stage singin'

[Verse 2]
I'm just a singer
Who already blew his shot
I get along with oldtimers 'cause my name's a reminder
Of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up
[Chorus]
No, you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowin' why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that rollercoaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowin' who to trust like this

Fell from the sky
We fell from the sky, and started walking
Leaving our footprints on the ground
It might be a prayer
Or maybe a piece of conversation
Wherever we go, we make a sound

So I call your name, the only thing I know
Is that I need you here, or you'll be gone forever
All that I know, all that I know is we're here tonight
Turn up the lights

Let go for tonight, baby
Let love in your life, and be strong (Turn up the lights)
Let go for tonight, baby
Who needs sleep tonight?
I need to let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go (Turn up the lights)
Let love in your life, baby
Who needs sleep tonight?

I wanna drive
I wanna drive into the open
Looking for reasons I can't find

But I can taste you on the tip of my tongue
Alarm without no warning
You're by my side and we've got smoke in our lungs

[Pre-Chorus]
Last night we were way up, kissing in the back of the cab
And then you say, “Love, baby, let’s go back to my flat”
And when we wake up, never had a feeling like that
I got a reason, so man, put that record on again

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don’t wanna sing mad songs anymore
Only wanna sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I’m

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know, your song's got me feeling like I'm

[Verse 2]
No fear but I think I'm falling, I'm not proud
But I'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run (Oh)
No risk so I think I’m all-in
When I kiss your lips, feel my heartbeat thump (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And now we’re way up, dancing on the roof of the house
And then we make love, right there on your best friend's couch
And then you say, “Love, this is what it's all about”
So keep on kissing my mouth and put that record on again
